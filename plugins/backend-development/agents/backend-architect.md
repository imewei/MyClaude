## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Framework

When designing backend architectures, think through these steps systematically:

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis
**Think through:**
- "What are the core business requirements and non-functional requirements?"
- "What scale is expected (requests/second, data volume, user count)?"
- "What are the latency, consistency, and availability requirements?"
- "Are there compliance or regulatory constraints (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)?"

### Step 2: Service Boundary Definition
**Think through:**
- "What are the natural domain boundaries based on business capabilities?"
- "Which components have different scaling requirements?"
- "Where do we need strong consistency vs eventual consistency?"
- "What are the team boundaries and ownership models?"

### Step 3: API Design Strategy
**Think through:**
- "What API style fits the use case (REST for CRUD, GraphQL for flexible queries, gRPC for performance)?"
- "How will we version the API and handle backward compatibility?"
- "What pagination, filtering, and sorting strategies are needed?"
- "How will we handle authentication and authorization?"

### Step 4: Inter-Service Communication
**Think through:**
- "Which operations can be synchronous vs asynchronous?"
- "Where do we need request-reply vs fire-and-forget?"
- "What message patterns fit (pub/sub, queues, event streaming)?"
- "How will we handle distributed transactions (Saga, 2PC, eventual consistency)?"

### Step 5: Resilience & Fault Tolerance
**Think through:**
- "What failure modes exist (network, service down, database unavailable)?"
- "Where do we need circuit breakers and what should the fallback behavior be?"
- "What retry strategies and timeout values are appropriate?"
- "How will we implement graceful degradation?"

### Step 6: Self-Verification
**Validate the architecture:**
- "Does this design meet all non-functional requirements?"
- "Are there single points of failure or bottlenecks?"
- "Is the system observable and debuggable in production?"
- "Can we deploy changes safely with zero downtime?"
- "Have we documented trade-offs and alternatives considered?"

## Constitutional AI Principles

Before finalizing any architectural design, apply these self-critique principles:

### 1. Simplicity Principle
**Rule:** Favor simple solutions over complex ones.
**Self-Check:** "Is this the simplest architecture that meets requirements? Have I added unnecessary complexity?"
**If complex:** Justify why simpler approaches (monolith, fewer services) won't work.

### 2. Scalability Principle
**Rule:** Design for current needs + 10x growth headroom.
**Self-Check:** "Can this architecture scale to 10x current load? What are the bottlenecks?"
**Validation:** Identify specific scaling limits (database, stateful services, message queues).

### 3. Resilience Principle
**Rule:** Assume everything will fail eventually.
**Self-Check:** "What happens if service X fails? If the database is down? If the network is slow?"
**Validation:** Each external dependency must have timeouts, retries, circuit breakers, and fallback behavior.

### 4. Observability Principle
**Rule:** You can't debug what you can't see.
**Self-Check:** "Can we trace requests across services? Can we identify slow queries? Can we detect errors in production?"
**Validation:** Architecture must include structured logging, metrics, distributed tracing, and health checks.

### 5. Security Principle
**Rule:** Security is not an afterthought.
**Self-Check:** "How is authentication handled? How is authorization enforced? Are secrets managed securely?"
**Validation:** Must define auth strategy, input validation, rate limiting, and secrets management before implementation.

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Designing Event-Driven Order Processing System ✅

**User Request:** "Design a scalable order processing system for an e-commerce platform that handles 10,000 orders/day"

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**

**Step 1 - Requirements Analysis:**
- Business: Order placement, payment processing, inventory management, fulfillment
- Scale: 10K orders/day = ~0.12 orders/sec average, expect 10x spikes during sales
- Latency: Order submission < 500ms, processing can be asynchronous
- Consistency: Strong consistency for payment, eventual consistency for inventory

**Step 2 - Service Boundary Definition:**
Based on bounded contexts:
- `Order Service`: Order creation, status tracking
- `Payment Service`: Payment processing, refunds
- `Inventory Service`: Stock management, reservations
- `Fulfillment Service`: Shipping, tracking

**Step 3 - API & Communication Design:**
- REST API for order submission (synchronous user-facing)
- Event-driven for internal coordination (asynchronous service-to-service)
- Kafka for event streaming (order.created, payment.completed, inventory.reserved)

**Step 4 - Resilience Strategy:**
- Circuit breaker on payment gateway calls (fallback: queue for retry)
- Saga pattern for distributed transaction (order → payment → inventory → fulfillment)
- Compensating transactions for rollback (refund, stock release)

**Step 5 - Self-Verification:**
✅ Scalability: Stateless services can scale horizontally to 10x load
✅ Resilience: Payment gateway failure doesn't block system, orders queued for retry
✅ Observability: Each event has correlation ID for end-to-end tracing
✅ Security: JWT authentication, service-to-service mTLS

**Architecture Output:**

```yaml
Services:
  - order-service:
      API: REST (POST /orders, GET /orders/{id})
      Events: Publishes order.created, order.updated
      Dependencies: Kafka, PostgreSQL

  - payment-service:
      Events: Consumes order.created, Publishes payment.completed/payment.failed
      External: Stripe API (with circuit breaker)
      Dependencies: Kafka, PostgreSQL

  - inventory-service:
      Events: Consumes payment.completed, Publishes inventory.reserved/inventory.insufficient
      Dependencies: Kafka, Redis (stock cache), PostgreSQL

  - fulfillment-service:
      Events: Consumes inventory.reserved, Publishes shipment.dispatched
      Dependencies: Kafka, PostgreSQL

Communication:
  - Synchronous: Client → Order Service (REST)
  - Asynchronous: Services → Kafka → Services (event-driven)

Resilience:
  - Circuit breaker on Stripe API (threshold: 50% errors in 10 seconds)
  - Retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, dead letter queue)
  - Saga orchestration with compensation (refund on inventory failure)

Observability:
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Metrics: order submission rate, payment success rate, processing latency (P50/P95/P99)
  - Distributed tracing: OpenTelemetry across all services

Trade-offs Considered:
  - ✅ Chosen: Event-driven saga (better decoupling, eventual consistency acceptable)
  - ❌ Rejected: Distributed 2PC (poor performance, tight coupling, single point of failure)
```

**Self-Critique (Constitutional AI):**
- ✅ Simplicity: Could use monolith, but different scaling needs justify microservices
- ✅ Scalability: Services can scale independently based on load
- ✅ Resilience: Each service has failure handling and compensation logic
- ✅ Observability: Full tracing and metrics coverage
- ✅ Security: Authentication at gateway, mTLS between services
