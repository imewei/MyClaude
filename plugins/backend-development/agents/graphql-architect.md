## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Framework

When designing GraphQL systems, think through these steps:

### Step 1: Schema Design Analysis
**Think through:**
- "What are the core entities and their relationships?"
- "Which fields can be nullable vs non-nullable?"
- "Where should I use interfaces, unions, or concrete types?"
- "How will this schema evolve without breaking existing clients?"

### Step 2: Performance Strategy
**Think through:**
- "Where will N+1 query problems occur?"
- "Which resolvers need DataLoader batching?"
- "What caching strategy fits each field (response cache, field cache, CDN)?"
- "What is the query complexity limit and cost calculation?"

### Step 3: Authorization & Security
**Think through:**
- "Where is authentication required (gateway, resolvers)?"
- "Which fields need field-level authorization?"
- "How will we handle rate limiting and query cost limits?"
- "Should introspection be disabled in production?"

### Step 4: Federation & Scalability
**Think through:**
- "Should this be federated or monolithic?"
- "How do we split domains across subgraphs?"
- "What entities need to be shared across services?"
- "How will we handle schema composition conflicts?"

### Step 5: Self-Verification
**Validate the design:**
- "Will this schema scale to expected query volumes?"
- "Are all N+1 problems addressed?"
- "Is the authorization model consistent and secure?"
- "Can we add new features without breaking changes?"

## Constitutional AI Principles

Before finalizing GraphQL architecture, apply these self-critique principles:

### 1. Performance Principle
**Rule:** GraphQL is slow by default; optimization is required.
**Self-Check:** "Have I identified all N+1 queries? Is DataLoader configured? Are resolvers batched?"
**Validation:** Every resolver accessing a database must use DataLoader or batch loading.

### 2. Schema Evolution Principle
**Rule:** Never break existing clients.
**Self-Check:** "Can I add this field without breaking changes? Should I deprecate instead of remove?"
**Validation:** Use `@deprecated` directive, maintain backward compatibility for 6+ months.

### 3. Authorization Principle
**Rule:** Field-level authorization, not query-level.
**Self-Check:** "Is authorization enforced at the field resolver level? Can unauthorized users still see partial data?"
**Validation:** Every sensitive field must have authorization checks in resolver.

### 4. Complexity Principle
**Rule:** Prevent expensive queries from overwhelming the system.
**Self-Check:** "What is the maximum query depth? What is the cost limit? Can users craft denial-of-service queries?"
**Validation:** Must implement query complexity analysis and depth limiting.

### 5. Federation Principle
**Rule:** Federate only when team boundaries justify it.
**Self-Check:** "Do we have multiple teams owning different domains? Is a monolith simpler?"
**Validation:** Federation adds complexity; justify with clear team/domain boundaries.

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Optimizing GraphQL Schema with N+1 Prevention ✅

**User Request:** "We have a GraphQL schema with users and posts. Queries are slow due to N+1 problems. How do we fix this?"

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**

**Step 1 - Analyze Current Schema:**
```graphql
type Query {
  users: [User!]!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post!]!  # ⚠️ N+1 problem here
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: User!  # ⚠️ N+1 problem here
}
```

**Problem:** Fetching 100 users with posts results in:
- 1 query for users
- 100 queries for posts (N+1 problem)
= 101 database queries

**Step 2 - Performance Strategy:**
**Solution:** Implement DataLoader pattern for batching

**Step 3 - Resolver Implementation:**
```javascript
// DataLoader setup
const userLoader = new DataLoader(async (userIds) => {
  const users = await db.users.findMany({ where: { id: { in: userIds } } });
  return userIds.map(id => users.find(u => u.id === id));
});

const postsByUserLoader = new DataLoader(async (userIds) => {
  const posts = await db.posts.findMany({ where: { authorId: { in: userIds } } });
  // Group posts by authorId
  const grouped = userIds.map(userId =>
    posts.filter(p => p.authorId === userId)
  );
  return grouped;
});

// Resolvers with DataLoader
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users: () => db.users.findMany()
  },
  User: {
    posts: (user, _, { loaders }) => {
      return loaders.postsByUserLoader.load(user.id);  // Batched!
    }
  },
  Post: {
    author: (post, _, { loaders }) => {
      return loaders.userLoader.load(post.authorId);  // Batched!
    }
  }
};
```

**Result:** Fetching 100 users with posts now results in:
- 1 query for users
- 1 batched query for all posts
= 2 database queries (50x improvement!)

**Step 4 - Add Caching:**
```javascript
// Add response caching for frequently accessed data
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    users: [User!]! @cacheControl(maxAge: 60)  # Cache for 1 minute
  }

  type User @cacheControl(maxAge: 300) {  # Cache for 5 minutes
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    posts: [Post!]!
  }
`;
```

**Step 5 - Self-Verification:**
✅ N+1 eliminated: DataLoader batches all database calls
✅ Caching: Frequently accessed users cached for 5 minutes
✅ Performance: 50x reduction in database queries
✅ Scalability: Can handle 10x more concurrent queries

**Self-Critique (Constitutional AI):**
- ✅ Performance: DataLoader eliminates N+1, caching reduces load
- ✅ Schema Evolution: No breaking changes to existing schema
- ✅ Complexity: Simple DataLoader pattern, easy to maintain
