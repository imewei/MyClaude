## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add imewei/MyClaude

# Install the plugin
/plugin install backend-development@scientific-computing-workflows
```

### Basic Usage

**1. Using the Backend Architect**

Ask Claude to design a backend system:
```
Design a scalable order processing system for an e-commerce platform handling 10K orders/day using the @backend-architect agent
```

The agent will:
- Analyze requirements systematically (scale, latency, consistency)
- Define service boundaries based on business capabilities
- Design API contracts and inter-service communication
- Plan resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries, timeouts)
- Create observability strategy
- Provide complete architecture with YAML/code examples
- Self-critique the design using Constitutional AI principles

**2. Using the GraphQL Architect**

Optimize a GraphQL schema:
```
I have a GraphQL schema with users and posts. Queries are slow due to N+1 problems. Help me fix this using the @graphql-architect agent
```

The agent will:
- Analyze the current schema structure
- Identify N+1 query problems
- Design DataLoader batching strategy
- Provide complete implementation code
- Show performance improvements (e.g., 101 queries â†’ 2 queries)
- Add caching strategies
- Validate with Constitutional AI principles

**3. Using the TDD Orchestrator**

Set up comprehensive TDD workflow:
```
Set up a TDD workflow for a new payment processing microservice using the @tdd-orchestrator agent
```

The agent will:
- Assess current TDD maturity
- Design red-green-refactor cycle enforcement
- Plan test architecture (unit, integration, E2E)
- Coordinate agents (test-automator, backend-architect, debugger)
- Define metrics and quality gates
- Provide pre-commit hooks and CI/CD configuration
- Create metrics dashboard specifications

## Use Cases

### Complex Backend Systems
- Full-stack application backends with multiple services
- E-commerce platforms with order processing, payments, inventory
- Real-time collaboration systems with WebSocket/GraphQL subscriptions
- Multi-tenant SaaS applications with tenant isolation

### API Development
- RESTful APIs with proper resource modeling and versioning
- GraphQL APIs with federation and N+1 prevention
- gRPC services for high-performance inter-service communication
- Webhook systems with retry logic and signature verification

### Microservices Architecture
- Service decomposition from monoliths
- Event-driven architectures with Kafka/RabbitMQ
- Saga patterns for distributed transactions
- API Gateway and service mesh implementations

### Testing & Quality
- TDD workflow implementation and enforcement
- Mutation testing and quality metrics
- Test automation across multiple test types
- CI/CD integration with quality gates

## Best Practices

### Using Agents

1. **Invoke with clear requirements** - Provide context about scale, latency, consistency needs
2. **Review chain-of-thought reasoning** - Agents explain their thinking step-by-step
3. **Check Constitutional AI validation** - Agents self-critique before finalizing
4. **Provide feedback** - Help improve agent performance over time

### Using Skills

1. **Skills are auto-discovered** - Claude Code finds relevant skills based on your task
2. **Review comprehensive examples** - Each skill includes production-ready code
3. **Follow best practices** - Skills encode modern backend development patterns
4. **Combine skills** - Use multiple skills together for complex scenarios
