**Impact**: Systematic decision-making process for complex architecture

#### ✅ Added: Constitutional AI Principles (CRITICAL)
- 5 self-critique principles with validation logic:
  1. **Simplicity Principle**: Favor simple solutions, justify complexity
  2. **Scalability Principle**: Design for current + 10x growth
  3. **Resilience Principle**: Assume everything fails, plan accordingly
  4. **Observability Principle**: Must be able to debug in production
  5. **Security Principle**: Security is not an afterthought

**Impact**: Built-in quality controls prevent production issues

#### ✅ Added: Comprehensive Few-Shot Example (CRITICAL)

- Explicit "DO NOT USE" for non-GraphQL tasks
- Decision tree distinguishing from backend-architect
- Focus on GraphQL-specific optimization and design

**Impact**: Clear delineation of GraphQL vs general backend tasks

#### ✅ Added: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Framework (CRITICAL)
- Structured 5-step GraphQL reasoning framework:
  1. Schema Design Analysis (entities, nullable fields, interfaces/unions, evolution)
  2. Performance Strategy (N+1 identification, DataLoader needs, caching, query complexity)
  3. Authorization & Security (auth location, field-level authz, rate limiting, introspection)
  4. Federation & Scalability (federated vs monolithic, domain splits, entity sharing)
  5. Self-Verification (scalability, N+1 addressed, authorization consistency, breaking changes)

**Impact**: Systematic GraphQL-specific decision-making

#### ✅ Added: Constitutional AI Principles (CRITICAL)
- 5 GraphQL-specific self-critique principles:
  1. **Performance Principle**: GraphQL is slow by default, optimization required

  2. TDD Workflow Design (red-green-refactor enforcement, agent coordination, automation)
  3. Test Architecture Planning (test pyramid, balance, property-based, fixtures)
  4. Agent Coordination Strategy (which agents, collaboration, handoffs, discipline)
  5. Metrics & Quality Gates (what to track, gates, effectiveness, alerts)
  6. Self-Verification (test-first enforced, fast feedback, maintainability, scalability)

**Impact**: Systematic TDD implementation and coordination

#### ✅ Added: Constitutional AI Principles (CRITICAL)
