name: Checking Session Security
description: |
  This skill enables Claude to check session security implementations within a codebase. It analyzes session management practices to identify potential vulnerabilities. Use this skill when a user requests to "check session security", "audit session handling", "review session implementation", or asks about "session security best practices" in their code. It helps identify issues like insecure session IDs, lack of proper session expiration, or insufficient protection against session fixation attacks. This skill leverages the session-security-checker plugin.

## Overview

This skill automates the process of reviewing session security within a project. It helps identify potential vulnerabilities related to session management, ensuring compliance with security best practices.

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Codebase**: The skill analyzes the codebase for session management related code.
2. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: It identifies potential vulnerabilities, such as weak session ID generation, missing session expiration, or susceptibility to session fixation.
3. **Generate Report**: The skill generates a report outlining the identified vulnerabilities and suggests remediation steps.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Check session security implementation.
- Audit session handling practices.
- Review session management code for vulnerabilities.
- Ensure compliance with session security best practices.

## Examples

### Example 1: Identifying Session Fixation Vulnerability

User request: "Check session security in my web application."

The skill will:
1. Analyze the code for session creation and management.
2. Identify if the application is vulnerable to session fixation attacks.

### Example 2: Reviewing Session Expiration Settings

User request: "Review session implementation to ensure proper expiration."

The skill will:
1. Analyze the code to determine how session expiration is handled.
2. Identify if sessions are expiring correctly and suggest appropriate timeout values.

## Best Practices

- **Input Validation**: Always validate user input to prevent session hijacking.
- **Session Expiration**: Implement proper session expiration to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Secure Session IDs**: Use strong, randomly generated session IDs.

## Integration

This skill can be used in conjunction with other security plugins to provide a comprehensive security assessment of the codebase. For example, it can be used alongside a vulnerability scanner to identify other potential security flaws.
