# Scripts

Bundled resources for chaos-engineering-toolkit skill

- [ ] inject_failure.py Script to inject specific failures (e.g., network latency, CPU overload) into a target system.
- [ ] validate_resilience.py Script to automatically validate resilience mechanisms (e.g., circuit breakers, retry logic) after failure injection.
- [ ] generate_report.py Script to generate a report summarizing the results of a chaos engineering experiment.
