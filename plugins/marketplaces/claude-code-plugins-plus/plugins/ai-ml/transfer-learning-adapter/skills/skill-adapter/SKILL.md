name: Adapting Transfer Learning Models
description: |
  This skill automates the adaptation of pre-trained machine learning models using transfer learning techniques. It is triggered when the user requests assistance with fine-tuning a model, adapting a pre-trained model to a new dataset, or performing transfer learning. It analyzes the user's requirements, generates code for adapting the model, includes data validation and error handling, provides performance metrics, and saves artifacts with documentation. Use this skill when you need to leverage existing models for new tasks or datasets, optimizing for performance and efficiency.

## Overview

This skill streamlines the process of adapting pre-trained machine learning models via transfer learning. It enables you to quickly fine-tune models for specific tasks, saving time and resources compared to training from scratch. It handles the complexities of model adaptation, data validation, and performance optimization.

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Examines the user's request to understand the target task, dataset characteristics, and desired performance metrics.
2. **Generate Adaptation Code**: Creates Python code using appropriate ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to fine-tune the pre-trained model on the new dataset. This includes data preprocessing steps and model architecture modifications if needed.
3. **Implement Validation and Error Handling**: Adds code to validate the data, monitor the training process, and handle potential errors gracefully.
4. **Provide Performance Metrics**: Calculates and reports key performance indicators (KPIs) such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.
5. **Save Artifacts and Documentation**: Saves the adapted model, training logs, performance metrics, and automatically generates documentation outlining the adaptation process and results.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model for a specific task.
- Adapt a pre-trained model to a new dataset.
- Perform transfer learning to improve model performance.
- Optimize an existing model for a particular application.

## Examples

### Example 1: Adapting a Vision Model for Image Classification

User request: "Fine-tune a ResNet50 model to classify images of different types of flowers."

The skill will:
1. Download the ResNet50 model and load a flower image dataset.
2. Generate code to fine-tune the model on the flower dataset, including data augmentation and optimization techniques.

### Example 2: Adapting a Language Model for Sentiment Analysis

User request: "Adapt a BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews."

The skill will:
1. Download the BERT model and load a dataset of customer reviews with sentiment labels.
2. Generate code to fine-tune the model on the review dataset, including tokenization, padding, and attention mechanisms.

## Best Practices

- **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure data is properly preprocessed and formatted to match the input requirements of the pre-trained model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) to optimize model performance.
- **Regularization**: Apply regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, weight decay) to prevent overfitting.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other plugins for data loading, model evaluation, and deployment. For example, it can work with a data loading plugin to fetch datasets and a model deployment plugin to deploy the adapted model to a serving infrastructure.
