name: Preprocessing Data with Automated Pipelines
description: |
  This skill empowers Claude to preprocess and clean data using automated pipelines. It is designed to streamline data preparation for machine learning tasks, implementing best practices for data validation, transformation, and error handling.  Claude should use this skill when the user requests data preprocessing, data cleaning, ETL tasks, or mentions the need for automated pipelines for data preparation. Trigger terms include "preprocess data", "clean data", "ETL pipeline", "data transformation", and "data validation". The skill ensures data quality and prepares it for effective analysis and model training.

## Overview

This skill enables Claude to construct and execute automated data preprocessing pipelines, ensuring data quality and readiness for machine learning. It streamlines the data preparation process by automating common tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and validation.

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Claude analyzes the user's request to understand the specific data preprocessing needs, including data sources, target format, and desired transformations.
2. **Generate Pipeline Code**: Based on the requirements, Claude generates Python code for an automated data preprocessing pipeline using relevant libraries and best practices. This includes data validation and error handling.
3. **Execute Pipeline**: The generated code is executed, performing the data preprocessing steps.
4. **Provide Metrics and Insights**: Claude provides performance metrics and insights about the pipeline's execution, including data quality reports and potential issues encountered.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Prepare raw data for machine learning models.
- Automate data cleaning and transformation processes.
- Implement a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

## Examples

### Example 1: Cleaning Customer Data

User request: "Preprocess the customer data from the CSV file to remove duplicates and handle missing values."

The skill will:
1. Generate a Python script to read the CSV file, remove duplicate entries, and impute missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., mean imputation).
2. Execute the script and provide a summary of the changes made, including the number of duplicates removed and the number of missing values imputed.

### Example 2: Transforming Sensor Data

User request: "Create an ETL pipeline to transform the sensor data from the database into a format suitable for time series analysis."

The skill will:
1. Generate a Python script to extract sensor data from the database, transform it into a time series format (e.g., resampling to a fixed frequency), and load it into a suitable storage location.
2. Execute the script and provide performance metrics, such as the time taken for each step of the pipeline and the size of the transformed data.

## Best Practices

- **Data Validation**: Always include data validation steps to ensure data quality and catch potential errors early in the pipeline.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected issues during pipeline execution.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the pipeline for performance by using efficient algorithms and data structures.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other Claude Code skills for data analysis, model training, and deployment. It provides a standardized way to prepare data for these tasks, ensuring consistency and reliability.
