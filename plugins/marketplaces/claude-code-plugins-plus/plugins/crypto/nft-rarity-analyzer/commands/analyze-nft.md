2. **Rarity Scoring Methods**:
   - **Statistical Rarity**: Based on trait frequency
   - **Trait Normalization**: Adjusted for trait count
   - **Rarity Score**: Weighted composite score
   - Compare different scoring methodologies

3. **Collection Context**:
   - Total supply and minted count
   - Floor price and volume metrics
   - Trait distribution across collection
   - Notable traits and anomalies

4. **Valuation Estimate**:
   - Compare to similar rarity NFTs
   - Analyze recent sales data

## Rarity Calculation Methods

### Statistical Rarity
```
Trait Rarity = 1 / (Trait Count / Total Supply)
Total Rarity = Sum of all trait rarities
```

### Trait Normalization
```
Normalized Score = Trait Rarity / Number of Traits
```

### OpenRarity Score
Uses information content and arithmetic mean of trait rarities.

## Data to Consider

When analyzing, reference:
- **OpenSea**: Collection stats, recent sales
- **Rarity.tools**: Rarity rankings
- **LooksRare**: Alternative marketplace data
- **Blur**: Professional trader activity
- **NFTGo**: Analytics and insights
