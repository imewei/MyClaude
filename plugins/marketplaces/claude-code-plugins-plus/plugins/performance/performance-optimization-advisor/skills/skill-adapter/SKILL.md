name: Providing Performance Optimization Advice
description: |
  This skill enables Claude to provide comprehensive, prioritized performance optimization recommendations for software projects. It is triggered when the user requests performance improvements, optimization suggestions, or asks for a performance review. The skill analyzes frontend, backend, and infrastructure aspects of the project to identify bottlenecks and anti-patterns. It then provides actionable advice, estimates potential performance gains, and suggests a phased implementation roadmap. Use this skill when the user mentions "optimize performance", "performance recommendations", "performance review", "improve speed", or asks about "bottlenecks".

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to act as a performance optimization advisor, delivering a detailed report of potential improvements across various layers of a software application. It prioritizes recommendations based on impact and effort, allowing for a focused and efficient optimization strategy.

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Project**: Claude uses the plugin to analyze the project's codebase, infrastructure configuration, and architecture.
2. **Identify Optimization Areas**: The plugin identifies potential optimization areas in the frontend, backend, and infrastructure.
3. **Prioritize Recommendations**: The plugin prioritizes recommendations based on estimated performance gains and implementation effort.
4. **Generate Report**: Claude presents a comprehensive report with actionable advice, performance gain estimates, and a phased implementation roadmap.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Identify performance bottlenecks in a software application.
- Get recommendations for improving website loading speed.
- Optimize database query performance.
- Improve API response times.
- Reduce infrastructure costs.

## Examples

### Example 1: Optimizing a Slow Website

User request: "My website is loading very slowly. Can you help me optimize its performance?"

The skill will:
1. Analyze the website's frontend code, backend APIs, and infrastructure configuration.
2. Identify issues such as unoptimized images, inefficient database queries, and lack of CDN usage.
3. Generate a report with prioritized recommendations, including image optimization, database query optimization, and CDN implementation.

### Example 2: Improving API Response Time

User request: "The API response time is too slow. What can I do to improve it?"

The skill will:
1. Analyze the API code, database queries, and caching strategies.
2. Identify issues such as inefficient database queries, lack of caching, and slow processing logic.
3. Generate a report with prioritized recommendations, including database query optimization, caching implementation, and asynchronous processing.

## Best Practices

- **Specificity**: Provide specific details about the project and its performance issues to get more accurate and relevant recommendations.
- **Context**: Explain the context of the performance problem, such as the expected user load or the specific use case.
- **Iteration**: Review the recommendations and provide feedback to refine the optimization strategy.

## Integration

This skill integrates well with other plugins that provide code analysis, infrastructure management, and deployment automation capabilities. For example, it can be used in conjunction with a code linting plugin to identify code-level performance issues or with an infrastructure-as-code plugin to automate infrastructure optimization tasks.
