name: Running Load Tests
description: |
  This skill enables Claude to create and execute load tests for performance validation. It is designed to generate load test scripts using tools like k6, JMeter, and Artillery, based on specified test scenarios. Use this skill when the user requests to create a "load test", conduct "performance testing", validate "application performance", or needs a "stress test" to identify breaking points in the application. The skill helps define performance thresholds and provides execution instructions.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to automate the creation and execution of load tests, ensuring applications can handle expected traffic and identify potential performance bottlenecks. It streamlines the process of defining test scenarios, generating scripts, and executing tests for comprehensive performance validation.

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Application**: Claude analyzes the user's request to understand the application's endpoints and critical paths.
2. **Identify Test Scenarios**: Claude identifies relevant test scenarios, such as baseline load, stress test, spike test, soak test, or scalability test, based on the user's requirements.
3. **Generate Load Test Scripts**: Claude generates load test scripts (k6, JMeter, Artillery, etc.) based on the selected scenarios and application details.
4. **Define Performance Thresholds**: Claude defines performance thresholds and provides execution instructions for the generated scripts.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Create load tests for a web application or API.
- Validate the performance of an application under different load conditions.
- Identify performance bottlenecks and breaking points.

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Stress Test

User request: "Create a stress test for the /api/users endpoint to simulate 1000 concurrent users."

The skill will:
1. Analyze the request and identify the need for a stress test on the /api/users endpoint.
2. Generate a k6 script that simulates 1000 concurrent users hitting the /api/users endpoint.

### Example 2: Validating Performance After a Code Change

User request: "Validate the performance of the application after the recent code changes with a baseline load test."

The skill will:
1. Identify the need for a baseline load test to validate performance.
2. Generate a JMeter script that simulates normal traffic patterns for the application.

## Best Practices

- **Realistic Scenarios**: Define load test scenarios that accurately reflect real-world usage patterns.
- **Threshold Definition**: Establish clear performance thresholds to identify potential issues.
- **Iterative Testing**: Run load tests iteratively to identify and address performance bottlenecks early in the development cycle.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines to automate performance testing as part of the deployment process. It can also be used in conjunction with monitoring tools to correlate performance metrics with application behavior.
