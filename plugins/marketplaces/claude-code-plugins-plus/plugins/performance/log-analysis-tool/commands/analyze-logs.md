# Log Analysis Tool

Analyze application logs to identify performance issues and optimization opportunities.

## Analysis Areas

1. **Slow Requests**: Identify requests exceeding latency thresholds
2. **Error Patterns**: Detect recurring errors and exceptions
3. **Resource Warnings**: Find resource exhaustion warnings
4. **Query Performance**: Extract slow database queries from logs
5. **Traffic Patterns**: Analyze request patterns and spikes
6. **Exception Trends**: Track exception frequency over time

## Process

1. Define log aggregation strategy
2. Set up structured logging if not present
3. Configure log parsing and indexing
4. Create performance-focused log queries
5. Build log analysis dashboards
6. Set up log-based alerts

## Output

Provide:
- Structured logging implementation guide
- Log aggregation setup (ELK, Loki, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Performance analysis queries
- Dashboard configurations showing:
  - Slow request distribution
  - Error rate trends
  - Performance degradation events
- Alert rules based on log patterns
- Log retention and cost optimization recommendations
