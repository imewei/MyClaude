Bundled resources for log-analysis-tool skill

- [ ] analyze_log_file.py: Script to parse a log file and extract key performance indicators (KPIs) such as slow requests, error rates, and resource usage. It should accept the log file path as an argument and output a structured summary.
- [ ] aggregate_logs.sh: Script to aggregate logs from multiple sources (e.g., different servers or containers) into a single file for analysis. It should support various log formats and filtering options.
- [ ] detect_anomalies.py: Script to detect anomalies in log data using statistical methods or machine learning algorithms. It should identify unusual patterns or deviations from the norm that may indicate performance issues or security threats.
