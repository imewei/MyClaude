## Integration with Repository Workflow

### Works With Existing Tools

Skills Powerkit **enhances** existing tools:
- Uses `./scripts/validate-all.sh` under the hood
- Calls `npm run sync-marketplace` automatically
- Validates with `jq` and `python3 scripts/check-frontmatter.py`
- Follows same standards as CI/CD

### CI/CD Compatibility

Skills run the **same checks as GitHub Actions**:
- `.github/workflows/validate-plugins.yml` checks
- Security scans match CI patterns
- Validation matches CI requirements
- **Fix issues before CI fails**

---

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI with Skills support (October 2025+)
- Working in `claude-code-plugins` repository
- Node.js for `npm run sync-marketplace`
- Python 3 for frontmatter validation
- `jq` for JSON validation
