name: Implementing Database Caching
description: |
  This skill enables Claude to implement multi-tier database caching solutions. It is triggered when the user requests database caching, performance improvements, or reduced database load. The skill utilizes Redis, in-memory caching, and CDN layers to optimize database performance by reducing database load, improving query latency, and supporting horizontal scaling with cache-aside, write-through, and read-through patterns. Use this skill when the user mentions terms like "database caching", "improve database performance", "reduce database load", or uses the `/caching` command.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to implement a production-ready multi-tier caching architecture for databases. It leverages Redis for distributed caching, in-memory caching for L1 performance, and CDN for static assets. This results in significant database load reduction, improved query latency, and enhanced scalability.

## How It Works

1. **Identify Caching Requirements**: Claude analyzes the user's request to determine specific caching needs and database technologies in use.
2. **Implement Caching Layers**: Claude generates code to implement Redis caching, in-memory caching, and CDN integration based on identified requirements.
3. **Configure Caching Strategies**: Claude sets up appropriate caching strategies such as cache-aside, write-through, or read-through to optimize performance and data consistency.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Implement a caching layer for a database.
- Improve database query performance.
- Reduce database load.

## Examples

### Example 1: Implementing Redis Caching

User request: "Implement Redis caching for my PostgreSQL database to improve query performance."

The skill will:
1. Generate code to integrate Redis as a caching layer for the PostgreSQL database.
2. Configure cache-aside strategy for frequently accessed data.

### Example 2: Adding In-Memory Caching

User request: "Add an in-memory cache layer to my application to reduce latency for frequently accessed data."

The skill will:
1. Implement an in-memory cache using a suitable library (e.g., `lru-cache` or similar).
2. Configure the application to check the in-memory cache before querying the database.

## Best Practices

- **Cache Invalidation**: Implement proper cache invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency.
- **Cache Key Design**: Design effective cache keys to avoid collisions and maximize cache hit rate.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor cache performance and adjust caching strategies as needed.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other database management and deployment tools to automate the entire caching implementation process. It also complements skills related to database schema design and query optimization.
