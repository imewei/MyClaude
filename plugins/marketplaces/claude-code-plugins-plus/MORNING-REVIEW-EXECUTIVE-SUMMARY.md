## 🔧 Critical Issue - RESOLVED

**Issue:** `overnight-dev` SKILL.md had markdown code fence before YAML frontmatter
**Impact:** Would fail YAML parsing
**Fix Applied:** Removed line 1 (`sed -i '1d' ...`)
**Verification:** ✅ Frontmatter now valid
**Time to Fix:** < 2 minutes

## 📈 Coverage by Category

### Perfect Coverage (100%)
- ✅ **ai-ml:** 27/27 plugins
- ✅ **database:** 25/25 plugins
- ✅ **security:** 27/27 plugins
- ✅ **testing:** 25/25 plugins
- ✅ **skill-enhancers:** 1/1 plugin

### Near-Perfect (96%+)
- ✅ **devops:** 28/29 plugins (96.6%)
- ✅ **performance:** 24/25 plugins (96.0%)

### Zero Coverage (Post-Release)
- ⏳ **api-development:** 0/25 plugins (25 missing)
- ⏳ **crypto:** 0/25 plugins (25 missing)
- ⏳ **ai-agency:** 0/6 plugins (6 missing)

**Justification for Release:** Core value categories (AI/ML, Database, Security, Testing) at 100% coverage. Lower-adoption categories (crypto, api-dev) acceptable for v1.0 release.
