# Deployment Configuration Report
**Project:** Claude Code Plugins Marketplace
**Domain:** claudecodeplugins.io
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

---

## Executive Summary

The claudecodeplugins.io marketplace website is **fully configured and ready for deployment**. All configuration files have been reviewed, a critical GitHub Actions workflow issue has been fixed, and comprehensive deployment documentation has been created.

**Key Finding:** The GitHub Actions workflow was using `pnpm` but the marketplace directory uses `npm`. This has been corrected.

---

## Configuration Status

### ✅ Astro Configuration
**File:** `/home/jeremy/000-projects/claude-code-plugins/marketplace/astro.config.mjs`

**Status:** Correctly configured for GitHub Pages deployment

**Settings:**
- Site URL: `https://claudecodeplugins.io` ✅
- Base path: `/` (root domain) ✅
- Output: `static` (required for GitHub Pages) ✅
- HTML compression: Enabled ✅
- Assets directory: `_astro` ✅

**Verdict:** No changes required

---

### ✅ CNAME File
**File:** `/home/jeremy/000-projects/claude-code-plugins/marketplace/public/CNAME`

**Status:** Present and correct

**Content:** `claudecodeplugins.io`

**Build Verification:** CNAME file is correctly copied to `dist/CNAME` during build ✅

**Verdict:** No changes required

---

### ⚠️ GitHub Actions Workflow (FIXED)
**File:** `/home/jeremy/000-projects/claude-code-plugins/.github/workflows/deploy-marketplace.yml`

**Status:** Workflow existed but had package manager mismatch

**Issue Found:**
- Workflow was using `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- Marketplace directory uses `npm` (has `package-lock.json`, not `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- This would cause deployment failures

**Fix Applied:**
```diff
- - name: Setup pnpm
-   uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
-   with:
-     version: 9
-
- - name: Install dependencies
-   run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
-
- - name: Build with Astro
-   run: pnpm run build

+ - name: Setup Node
+   uses: actions/setup-node@v6
+   with:
+     node-version: '20'
+     cache: 'npm'
+     cache-dependency-path: './marketplace/package-lock.json'
+
+ - name: Install dependencies
+   run: npm ci
+
+ - name: Build with Astro
+   run: npm run build
```

**Improvements:**
1. Changed from `pnpm` to `npm` to match package manager
2. Added npm caching for faster builds
3. Specified cache dependency path for proper cache invalidation
4. Uses `npm ci` for faster, deterministic installs (recommended for CI/CD)

**Verdict:** Fixed and ready for deployment

---
