## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails in GitHub Actions
1. Check Actions logs: https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins/actions
2. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies: Check `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
   - Node version mismatch: Verify Node 20 is used
   - Build errors: Run `npm run build` locally first
   - Working directory: Ensure `working-directory: ./marketplace` is set

### Site Not Updating
1. Check deployment status in Actions tab
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check GitHub Pages settings (custom domain configured)
4. Verify CNAME file in repository root (should NOT exist - only in marketplace/public/)
5. Wait 5-10 minutes for CDN cache to clear

### Custom Domain Not Working
1. Verify DNS records with `dig claudecodeplugins.io`
2. Check CNAME file exists in `marketplace/public/CNAME`
3. Verify CNAME file is in `dist/CNAME` after build
4. Re-save custom domain in GitHub Pages settings
5. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
6. Check for DNS configuration errors: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#A/claudecodeplugins.io

### HTTPS Not Working
1. Ensure "Enforce HTTPS" is enabled in GitHub Pages settings
2. Wait 10-15 minutes for certificate provisioning
3. Check certificate status: `openssl s_client -connect claudecodeplugins.io:443`
4. Clear browser cache
5. Try incognito/private browsing mode

### 404 Errors
1. Verify base path in `astro.config.mjs` is `/`
2. Check that `dist/` contains `index.html`
3. Verify GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
4. Clear GitHub Pages cache by re-saving custom domain

## Rollback Procedure

### If Deployment Fails or Site is Broken
1. **Quick Fix:** Revert to previous commit
   ```bash
   cd /home/jeremy/000-projects/claude-code-plugins
   git log marketplace/ --oneline -10  # Find last working commit
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Emergency Rollback:** Re-deploy previous version
   ```bash
   git reset --hard <last-working-commit>
   git push --force origin main  # Use with caution!
   ```

3. **Local Testing Before Fix:**
   ```bash
   cd marketplace/
   npm run build
   npm run preview  # Test at http://localhost:4321
   ```
