## Overview

This skill helps you create well-formatted, informative commit messages that follow the conventional commits standard, improving collaboration and automation in your Git workflow. It saves you time and ensures consistency across your project.

## How It Works

2. **Generate Suggestion**: It uses AI to generate a commit message based on the analyzed changes, adhering to the conventional commits format (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: correct bug`).
3. **Present to User**: The generated commit message is presented to you for review and acceptance.

## When to Use This Skill

- Create a commit message after making code changes.
- Ensure your commit messages follow the conventional commits standard.
- Save time writing commit messages manually.

## Examples

### Example 1: Adding a New Feature

User request: "Generate a commit message for these changes."

The skill will:
1. Analyze the staged changes related to a new feature.
2. Generate a commit message like `feat: Implement user authentication`.

### Example 2: Fixing a Bug

User request: "Create a commit for the bug fix."

The skill will:
1. Analyze the staged changes related to a bug fix.

## Best Practices

- **Stage Changes**: Ensure all relevant changes are staged before using the skill.
