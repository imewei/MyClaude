name: Creating Kubernetes Deployments
description: |
  This skill enables Claude to generate Kubernetes deployment manifests, services, and related configurations following best practices. It should be used when the user asks to create a new Kubernetes deployment, service, ingress, or other related resources. Claude will generate YAML files for Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Ingress, and Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. Use this skill when the user mentions "Kubernetes deployment", "K8s deployment", "create service", "define ingress", or asks for a manifest for any K8s resource.

## Overview

This skill allows Claude to create production-ready Kubernetes deployments and services. It generates complete K8s manifests with health checks, auto-scaling, ingress, TLS, and resource management configured.

## How It Works

1. **Receiving Request**: Claude receives a request to create Kubernetes resources.
2. **Generating Manifests**: Claude generates YAML manifests for deployments, services, configmaps, secrets, ingress, and horizontal pod autoscalers based on the user's requirements.
3. **Presenting Manifests**: Claude presents the generated manifests to the user for review and deployment.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Create a new Kubernetes deployment.
- Define a Kubernetes service for an application.
- Generate Kubernetes manifests for any K8s resource.

## Examples

### Example 1: Deploying a Web Application

User request: "Create a Kubernetes deployment for a web application named 'my-web-app' with 3 replicas, exposing port 80."

The skill will:
1. Generate a Deployment manifest for 'my-web-app' with 3 replicas.
2. Generate a Service manifest to expose port 80 of the deployment.

### Example 2: Setting up Ingress for a Service

User request: "Set up an Ingress resource to route traffic to the 'my-web-app' service."

The skill will:
1. Generate an Ingress manifest to route external traffic to the 'my-web-app' service.
2. Configure TLS termination for secure access.

## Best Practices

- **Resource Limits**: Define resource requests and limits for each container to ensure fair resource allocation.
- **Health Checks**: Configure liveness and readiness probes to enable automatic restarts and prevent traffic from being routed to unhealthy pods.
- **Namespaces**: Use namespaces to isolate different environments or applications within the cluster.

## Integration

This skill can be used with other Claude Code plugins for tasks such as deploying infrastructure-as-code (IaC) or integrating with CI/CD pipelines. It provides the Kubernetes manifests that other plugins can then deploy or manage.
