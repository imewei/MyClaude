name: Scanning for Data Privacy Issues
description: |
  This skill enables Claude to automatically scan code and configuration files for potential data privacy vulnerabilities using the data-privacy-scanner plugin. It identifies sensitive data exposure, compliance violations, and other privacy-related risks. Use this skill when the user requests to "scan for data privacy issues", "check privacy compliance", "find PII leaks", "identify GDPR violations", or needs a "privacy audit" of their codebase. The skill is most effective when used on projects involving personal data, financial information, or health records.

## Overview

This skill automates the process of identifying data privacy risks within a codebase. By leveraging the data-privacy-scanner plugin, Claude can quickly pinpoint potential vulnerabilities, helping developers proactively address compliance requirements and protect sensitive user data.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Scan**: Upon detecting a privacy-related trigger phrase, Claude activates the data-privacy-scanner plugin.
2. **Analyze Codebase**: The plugin analyzes the specified files or the entire project for potential data privacy violations.
3. **Report Findings**: The plugin generates a detailed report outlining identified risks, including the location of the vulnerability and a description of the potential impact.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Identify potential data privacy vulnerabilities in a codebase.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA.
- Perform a privacy audit of a project involving sensitive user data.

## Examples

### Example 1: Identifying PII Leaks

User request: "Scan this project for PII leaks."

The skill will:
1. Activate the data-privacy-scanner plugin to analyze the project.
2. Generate a report highlighting potential Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leaks, such as exposed email addresses or phone numbers.

### Example 2: Checking GDPR Compliance

User request: "Check this configuration file for GDPR compliance issues."

The skill will:
1. Activate the data-privacy-scanner plugin to analyze the specified configuration file.
2. Generate a report identifying potential GDPR violations, such as insufficient data anonymization or improper consent management.

## Best Practices

- **Scope**: Specify the relevant files or directories to narrow the scope of the scan and improve performance.
- **Context**: Provide context about the type of data being processed to help the plugin identify relevant privacy risks.
- **Review**: Carefully review the generated report to understand the identified vulnerabilities and implement appropriate remediation measures.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other security and compliance tools to provide a comprehensive approach to data privacy. For example, it can be combined with vulnerability scanning tools to identify related security risks or with reporting tools to track progress on remediation efforts.
