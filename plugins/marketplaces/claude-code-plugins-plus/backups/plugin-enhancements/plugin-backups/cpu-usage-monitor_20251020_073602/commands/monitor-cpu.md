# CPU Usage Monitor

Analyze code for CPU-intensive operations and optimize processor utilization.

## Analysis Areas

1. **Computational Complexity**: Identify O(nÂ²) or worse algorithms
2. **Synchronous Operations**: Blocking operations on main thread
3. **Loop Optimization**: Inefficient iteration patterns
4. **Regular Expressions**: CPU-heavy regex patterns
5. **Recursive Functions**: Deep or inefficient recursion
6. **String Operations**: Excessive string concatenation
7. **JSON Processing**: Large JSON parsing operations

## Process

1. Scan codebase for CPU-intensive patterns
2. Analyze algorithmic complexity
3. Identify blocking operations
4. Check for optimization opportunities
5. Generate report with recommendations

## Output

Provide:
- CPU hotspot identification with file locations
- Complexity analysis for key algorithms
- Before/after code examples for optimizations
- Estimated performance improvements
- Best practices for CPU efficiency
