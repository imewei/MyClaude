name: Validating AI Ethics and Fairness
description: |
  This skill enables Claude to validate the ethical implications and fairness of AI/ML models and datasets. It is triggered when the user requests an ethics review, fairness assessment, or bias detection for an AI system. The skill uses the ai-ethics-validator plugin to analyze models, datasets, and code for potential biases and ethical concerns. It provides reports and recommendations for mitigating identified issues, ensuring responsible AI development and deployment. Use this skill when the user mentions "ethics validation", "fairness assessment", "bias detection", "responsible AI", or related terms in the context of AI/ML.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to automatically assess and improve the ethical considerations and fairness of AI and machine learning projects. It leverages the ai-ethics-validator plugin to identify potential biases, evaluate fairness metrics, and suggest mitigation strategies, promoting responsible AI development.

## How It Works

1. **Analysis Initiation**: The skill is triggered by user requests related to AI ethics, fairness, or bias detection.
2. **Ethical Validation**: The ai-ethics-validator plugin analyzes the provided AI model, dataset, or code for potential ethical concerns and biases.
3. **Report Generation**: The plugin generates a detailed report outlining identified issues, fairness metrics, and recommended mitigation strategies.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Evaluate the fairness of an AI model across different demographic groups.
- Detect and mitigate bias in a training dataset.
- Assess the ethical implications of an AI-powered application.

## Examples

### Example 1: Fairness Evaluation

User request: "Evaluate the fairness of this loan application model."

The skill will:
1. Invoke the ai-ethics-validator plugin to analyze the model's predictions across different demographic groups.
2. Generate a report highlighting any disparities in approval rates or loan terms.

### Example 2: Bias Detection

User request: "Detect bias in this image recognition dataset."

The skill will:
1. Utilize the ai-ethics-validator plugin to analyze the dataset for representation imbalances across different categories.
2. Generate a report identifying potential biases and suggesting data augmentation or re-sampling strategies.

## Best Practices

- **Data Integrity**: Ensure the input data is accurate, representative, and properly preprocessed.
- **Metric Selection**: Choose appropriate fairness metrics based on the specific application and potential impact.
- **Transparency**: Document the ethical considerations and mitigation strategies implemented throughout the AI development process.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other plugins for data analysis, model training, and deployment to ensure ethical considerations are incorporated throughout the entire AI lifecycle. For example, it can be combined with a data visualization plugin to explore the distribution of data across different demographic groups.
