name: Encrypting and Decrypting Data
description: |
  This skill enables Claude to encrypt and decrypt data using various algorithms provided by the encryption-tool plugin. It should be used when the user requests to "encrypt data", "decrypt a file", "generate an encrypted file", or needs to secure sensitive information. This skill supports various encryption methods and ensures data confidentiality. It is triggered by requests related to data encryption, decryption, or general data security needs.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to handle data encryption and decryption tasks seamlessly. It leverages the encryption-tool plugin to provide a secure way to protect sensitive information, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

## How It Works

1. **Identify Encryption/Decryption Request**: Claude analyzes the user's request to determine whether encryption or decryption is required.
2. **Select Encryption Method**: Claude prompts the user to specify the desired encryption algorithm (e.g., AES, RSA). If not specified, a default secure method is chosen.
3. **Execute Encryption/Decryption**: Claude utilizes the encryption-tool plugin to perform the encryption or decryption operation on the provided data or file.
4. **Return Encrypted/Decrypted Data**: Claude presents the encrypted or decrypted data to the user, or saves the result to a file as requested.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Encrypt sensitive data before storage or transmission.
- Decrypt previously encrypted data for access or processing.
- Generate encrypted files for secure archiving.

## Examples

### Example 1: Encrypting a Text File

User request: "Encrypt the file 'sensitive_data.txt' using AES."

The skill will:
1. Activate the encryption-tool plugin.
2. Encrypt the contents of 'sensitive_data.txt' using AES encryption.
3. Save the encrypted data to a new file (e.g., 'sensitive_data.txt.enc').

### Example 2: Decrypting an Encrypted File

User request: "Decrypt the file 'confidential.txt.enc'."

The skill will:
1. Activate the encryption-tool plugin.
2. Decrypt the contents of 'confidential.txt.enc' using the appropriate decryption key (assumed to be available or prompted for).
3. Save the decrypted data to a new file (e.g., 'confidential.txt').

## Best Practices

- **Key Management**: Always store encryption keys securely and avoid hardcoding them in scripts.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose encryption algorithms based on the sensitivity of the data and the required security level. Consider industry best practices and compliance requirements.
- **Data Integrity**: Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of encrypted data to detect tampering or corruption.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other Claude Code plugins, such as file management tools, to automate the encryption and decryption of files during data processing workflows. It can also be combined with security auditing tools to ensure compliance with security policies.
