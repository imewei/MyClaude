# Process

## 1. Parse Input

Extract:
- **Amount**: Numeric value to convert
- **From currency**: Source currency code (ISO 4217)
- **To currency**: Target currency code
- **Context**: Use trip destination if available

Examples:

→ Convert $1000 to Japanese Yen
```

## 2. Fetch Exchange Rates

Call currency API:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/convert-currency.sh "[from]" "[to]" "[amount]"
```

```json
{
  "base": "USD",
  "date": "2025-10-12",
  "rates": {
    "EUR": 0.925,
    "GBP": 0.791,
    "JPY": 149.85,
    ...
  }
}
```
