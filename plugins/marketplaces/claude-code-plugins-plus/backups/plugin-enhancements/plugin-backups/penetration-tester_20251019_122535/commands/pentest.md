# Penetration Tester

Execute automated penetration testing against web applications, APIs, and infrastructure to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.

## Testing Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Port scanning
   - Service enumeration
   - Technology fingerprinting
   - Directory/file discovery

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - SQL injection testing
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
   - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
   - Authentication bypass
   - Authorization flaws
   - Session management issues

3. **Exploitation Attempts** (Safe Mode)
   - Proof of concept exploits
   - Privilege escalation tests
   - Data exfiltration simulations
   - Command injection tests

4. **Post-Exploitation**
   - Lateral movement assessment
   - Persistence mechanisms
   - Data access verification
   - Impact analysis
