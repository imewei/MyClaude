name: Generating Compliance Reports
description: |
  This skill enables Claude to generate compliance reports based on various security standards and frameworks. It leverages the compliance-report-generator plugin to automate the report creation process. Use this skill when a user requests a "compliance report", "security audit report", or needs documentation for "regulatory compliance". The skill is particularly useful for generating reports related to standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, or ISO 27001. It can also assist with documenting adherence to specific security policies.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to create detailed compliance reports, saving time and ensuring accuracy in documenting security practices. It automates the process of gathering information and formatting it into a standardized report, making compliance audits easier and more efficient.

## How It Works

1. **Identify Report Type**: Claude analyzes the user's request to determine the required compliance standard (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA).
2. **Gather Data**: The plugin collects relevant data from the system or prompts the user for necessary information.
3. **Generate Report**: The plugin formats the collected data into a comprehensive compliance report, including necessary sections and documentation.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Generate a report for a specific compliance standard (e.g., "generate a HIPAA compliance report").
- Create a security audit report.
- Document adherence to a security policy.
- Prepare for a compliance audit.

## Examples

### Example 1: Generating a PCI DSS Compliance Report

User request: "Generate a PCI DSS compliance report for our e-commerce platform."

The skill will:
1. Activate the compliance-report-generator plugin.
2. Prompt the user for information about their e-commerce platform's security controls and processes.
3. Generate a detailed PCI DSS compliance report based on the provided information.

### Example 2: Creating a HIPAA Compliance Report

User request: "Create a HIPAA compliance report to demonstrate our adherence to privacy regulations."

The skill will:
1. Activate the compliance-report-generator plugin.
2. Guide the user through a series of questions related to HIPAA requirements.
3. Compile the answers into a structured HIPAA compliance report.

## Best Practices

- **Specificity**: Be specific about the compliance standard you need a report for (e.g., "SOC 2 report").
- **Completeness**: Provide all the necessary information requested by the plugin to ensure a comprehensive and accurate report.
- **Review**: Always review the generated report to ensure its accuracy and completeness before submitting it for an audit.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other plugins that provide security assessment or vulnerability scanning capabilities. The results from those plugins can be incorporated into the compliance reports generated by this skill, providing a more comprehensive view of the organization's security posture.
