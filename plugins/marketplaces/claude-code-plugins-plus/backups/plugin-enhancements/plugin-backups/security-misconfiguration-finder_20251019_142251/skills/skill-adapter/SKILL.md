name: Finding Security Misconfigurations
description: |
  This skill enables Claude to identify potential security misconfigurations in various systems and configurations. It leverages the security-misconfiguration-finder plugin to analyze infrastructure-as-code, application configurations, and system settings, pinpointing common vulnerabilities and compliance issues. Use this skill when the user asks to "find security misconfigurations", "check for security vulnerabilities in my configuration", "audit security settings", or requests a security assessment of a specific system or file. This skill will assist in identifying and remediating potential security weaknesses.

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to proactively detect security misconfigurations before they can be exploited. By utilizing the security-misconfiguration-finder plugin, Claude can analyze various configuration files and system settings to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security best practices. This allows for early detection and remediation of security weaknesses.

## How It Works

1. **Receive User Request**: Claude receives a user request related to security misconfigurations.
2. **Activate Plugin**: Claude activates the security-misconfiguration-finder plugin.
3. **Analyze Configuration**: The plugin analyzes the specified configuration files or system settings.
4. **Identify Misconfigurations**: The plugin identifies potential security misconfigurations based on predefined rules and best practices.
5. **Present Findings**: Claude presents the identified misconfigurations to the user, along with recommendations for remediation.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Identify potential security vulnerabilities in infrastructure-as-code deployments (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
- Audit application configurations for security misconfigurations (e.g., insecure defaults, missing security headers).
- Check system settings for compliance with security best practices (e.g., password policies, access controls).

## Examples

### Example 1: Security Audit of a Terraform Configuration

User request: "Find security misconfigurations in my Terraform configuration file main.tf"

The skill will:
1. Activate the security-misconfiguration-finder plugin.
2. Analyze the `main.tf` file for security vulnerabilities.
3. Report any identified misconfigurations, such as publicly accessible resources or insecure network configurations.

### Example 2: Checking Application Configuration for Security Issues

User request: "Check my application's configuration file application.yml for security vulnerabilities."

The skill will:
1. Activate the security-misconfiguration-finder plugin.
2. Analyze the `application.yml` file.
3. Identify issues like exposed API keys or disabled security features.

## Best Practices

- **Specify Target**: Always specify the target configuration file or system settings to be analyzed.
- **Review Findings**: Carefully review the identified misconfigurations and prioritize remediation based on risk.
- **Regular Audits**: Schedule regular security audits to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other plugins, such as infrastructure-as-code deployment tools, to automatically check for security misconfigurations before deployment. It can also be used in conjunction with reporting plugins to generate security audit reports.
