name: Creating GitHub Issues from Web Research
description: |
  This skill enhances Claude's ability to conduct web research and translate findings into actionable GitHub issues. It automates the process of extracting key information from web search results and formatting it into a well-structured issue, ready for team action. Use this skill when you need to research a topic and create a corresponding GitHub issue for tracking, collaboration, and task management. Trigger this skill by requesting Claude to "research [topic] and create a ticket" or "find [information] and generate a GitHub issue".

## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to streamline the research-to-implementation workflow. By integrating web search with GitHub issue creation, Claude can efficiently convert research findings into trackable tasks for development teams.

## How It Works

1. **Web Search**: Claude utilizes its web search capabilities to gather information on the specified topic.
2. **Information Extraction**: The plugin extracts relevant details, key findings, and supporting evidence from the search results.
3. **GitHub Issue Creation**: A new GitHub issue is created with a clear title, a summary of the research, key recommendations, and links to the original sources.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Investigate a technical topic and create an implementation ticket.
- Track security vulnerabilities and generate a security issue with remediation steps.
- Research competitor features and create a feature request ticket.

## Examples

### Example 1: Researching Security Best Practices

User request: "research Docker security best practices and create a ticket in myorg/backend"

The skill will:
1. Search the web for Docker security best practices.
2. Extract key recommendations, security vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies.
3. Create a GitHub issue in the specified repository with a summary of the findings, a checklist of best practices, and links to relevant resources.

### Example 2: Investigating API Rate Limiting

User request: "find articles about API rate limiting, create issue with label performance"

The skill will:
1. Search the web for articles and documentation on API rate limiting.
2. Extract different rate limiting techniques, their pros and cons, and implementation examples.
3. Create a GitHub issue with the "performance" label, summarizing the findings and providing links to the source articles.

## Best Practices

- **Specify Repository**: When creating issues for a specific project, explicitly mention the repository name to ensure the issue is created in the correct location.
- **Use Labels**: Add relevant labels to the issue to categorize it appropriately and facilitate issue tracking.
- **Provide Context**: Include sufficient context in your request to guide the web search and ensure the generated issue contains the most relevant information.

## Integration

This skill seamlessly integrates with Claude's web search Skill and requires authentication with a GitHub account. It can be used in conjunction with other skills to further automate development workflows.
