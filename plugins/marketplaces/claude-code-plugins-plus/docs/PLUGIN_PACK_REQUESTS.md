## Plugin Component Types

### üéØ Agent Skills (Model-Invoked)

**What they are:** Capabilities Claude uses automatically based on conversation context

**Example:** Skills Powerkit
- Say "create a plugin" ‚Üí Plugin Creator skill activates
- Say "validate plugin" ‚Üí Plugin Validator skill runs
- No `/command` needed!

**When to request:**
- Workflows you do repeatedly
- Tasks that should "just happen" when mentioned
- Context-aware automation

**Template section:** "Agent Skills Requested"

---

### ü§ñ Subagents (Domain Experts)

**What they are:** Specialized AI agents invoked explicitly or through context

**Example:** DevOps Pack agents
- Docker Expert - Container optimization, Dockerfile best practices
- Kubernetes Agent - Cluster management, YAML configs
- Terraform Architect - Infrastructure as code patterns

**When to request:**
- Deep domain expertise needed
- Q&A and complex debugging
- Strategic guidance on architecture

**Template section:** "Subagents Requested"

---

### ‚ö° Slash Commands (User-Invoked)

**What they are:** Custom shortcuts triggered with `/command-name` syntax

**Example:** DevOps Pack commands
- `/docker-optimize` - Analyzes and optimizes Dockerfile
- `/k8s-health` - Checks Kubernetes cluster health
- `/tf-init` - Scaffolds Terraform project structure

**When to request:**
- Scaffolding and templates
- One-time operations
- Explicit control needed

**Template section:** "Slash Commands Requested"

---

### ü™ù Hooks (Event-Driven)

**What they are:** Automation that triggers on specific events (file edits, tool usage)

**Example:** Formatter plugin
- **PostToolUse hook** - Auto-formats code after every file edit

**When to request:**
- Background automation
- Enforce standards automatically
- React to events

**Template section:** "Desired Plugin Components" checkbox

---

### üîß MCP Servers (Real Code)

**What they are:** External TypeScript/Node.js applications with actual compiled code

**Example:** Project Health Auditor
- Real code complexity analysis
- Git churn detection
- Test coverage mapping

**When to request:**
- Need actual code execution (not AI interpretation)
- Performance-critical operations
- External tool integration (databases, APIs)

**Template section:** "Desired Plugin Components" checkbox + "Integration Requirements"

## Tips for Great Requests

### ‚úÖ Do This

**1. Be Specific About Workflows**
```
‚ùå "I need DevOps plugins"
‚úÖ "I deploy microservices to Kubernetes daily. I need:
   - Automated health checks before deployment
   - Rollback if errors detected
   - Slack notifications on status changes"
```

**2. Differentiate Component Types**
```
‚ùå "I want a data cleaner"
‚úÖ "I want a Data Cleaner Agent SKILL that auto-activates when I say
   'clean dataset', 'handle missing values', or 'preprocess data'"
```

**3. Show Time Savings**
```
‚ùå "This would be helpful"
‚úÖ "Currently takes 45 minutes manually. With this pack: 2 minutes.
   Saves 5-6 hours/week across my team."
```

**4. Provide Trigger Keywords (for Skills)**
```
‚ùå "Auto-clean data"
‚úÖ "Trigger keywords: 'clean data', 'handle missing values',
   'remove outliers', 'preprocess dataset'"
```

**5. Offer to Help**
```
‚úÖ "I can:
   - Test beta versions
   - Provide real-world example workflows
   - Write documentation based on my use cases"
```

### ‚ùå Avoid This

**1. Vague Requests**
```
‚ùå "Make AI better"
‚ùå "I need productivity tools"
‚ùå "Build something cool"
```

**2. No Use Cases**
```
‚ùå Just listing plugin names without explaining WHY
```

**3. Requesting Everything**
```
‚ùå "100 plugins covering every possible workflow"
```

**4. Unrealistic Timelines**
```
‚ùå "Need this by tomorrow"
```

**5. No Differentiation**
```
‚ùå "I want a data plugin" (Skill? Command? Agent? MCP server?)
```

## Example: Perfect Plugin Pack Request

### üìã Request

**Pack Name:** ML Engineering Pack

**Use Case:**
I'm a data scientist who spends 2-3 hours/day on repetitive ML tasks: data cleaning, experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, model deployment. I want to reduce this to 15-30 minutes so I can focus on research.

**Target Audience:** Intermediate ML engineers using PyTorch/scikit-learn

**Time Savings:** 2-3 hours/day ‚Üí 30 minutes/day = 10-12 hours/week saved

---

   - **Trigger keywords:** "clean data", "handle missing values", "preprocess dataset", "remove outliers"
   - **Output:** Python code for data cleaning with explanations

2. **Experiment Tracker**
   - **What it does:** Auto-logs hyperparameters, metrics, artifacts to MLflow
   - **Trigger keywords:** "track experiment", "log results", "save metrics", "record this run"
   - **Output:** Adds MLflow logging to training code

3. **Model Trainer**
   - **What it does:** Scaffolds training loops with best practices (early stopping, logging, checkpoints)

## FAQ

### Q: How long does it take?

**A:** 2-6 weeks depending on:
- Pack size (small/medium/large)
- Complexity (simple commands vs Agent Skills)
- MCP servers needed (real code takes longer)
- Community contributor availability

### Q: Can I request just 1-2 plugins?

**A:** Yes! Not every request needs to be a full pack. For single plugin requests, use the [Feature Request](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins/issues/new?template=feature-request.yml) issue template instead.

### Q: What if my request is declined?

**A:** Maintainers will explain why and suggest alternatives:
- Scope too large ‚Üí Break into smaller packs
- Overlaps with existing ‚Üí Use existing pack + customization
- Too niche ‚Üí Consider building it yourself (we'll help!)

### Q: Can I build it myself?

**A:** Absolutely! Check out:
- [Creating Plugins Guide](./creating-plugins.md)
- [Plugin Templates](../templates/)
- [Skills Powerkit](../plugins/examples/skills-powerkit/) - Use it to scaffold your pack!

### Q: How do I know if Skills or Commands are better?

**Skills (Model-Invoked):**
- ‚úÖ Use when: Task is frequent, should "just happen" when mentioned
- ‚úÖ Example: "clean data" ‚Üí Data Cleaner activates automatically

**Commands (User-Invoked):**
- ‚úÖ Use when: One-time operation, explicit control needed
- ‚úÖ Example: `/deploy-model` ‚Üí You control when it runs

**Both:**
- ‚úÖ Use when: Pack has frequent tasks (Skills) + one-time operations (Commands)

### Q: Can I request updates to existing packs?

**A:** Yes! Use the same template but specify it's an enhancement to an existing pack. Maintainers will evaluate feasibility.
