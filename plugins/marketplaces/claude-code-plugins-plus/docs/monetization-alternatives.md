# Monetization Alternatives for Claude Code Plugins

## Important Context

Ô∏è **Claude Code plugins have NO built-in monetization mechanism.** There is no payment processing, licensing enforcement, or revenue sharing in the official plugin system. All plugins in the Claude Code ecosystem are currently free and open-source.

This guide covers **external monetization strategies** that work outside the plugin system.

Claude Code plugins:
- Are distributed through Git repositories

- Have no license enforcement mechanisms
- Follow an open-source ecosystem model
- Are in early beta (October 2025) - monetization may come later

## Alternative Monetization Strategies
