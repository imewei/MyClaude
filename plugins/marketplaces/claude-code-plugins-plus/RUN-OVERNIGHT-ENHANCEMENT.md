# Overnight Plugin Enhancement System
**Run Gemini overnight to enhance ALL 236 plugins automatically**

---

## What This Does

Uses Vertex AI Gemini (free tier) to:
1. **Analyze** each plugin against Anthropic's official standards
2. **Identify** missing pieces (bundled resources, content depth, writing style)
3. **Generate** comprehensive SKILL.md files (8,000+ bytes)
4. **Create** bundled resource directories (scripts/, references/, assets/)
5. **Validate** and backup before applying changes
6. **Track** everything in SQLite audit database

## Prerequisites

```bash
# 1. Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth application-default login

# 2. Verify Vertex AI access
gcloud projects describe ccpi-web-app-prod

# 3. Check Python dependencies
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
```

## Test on Single Plugin First

```bash
# Test on overnight-dev (our featured plugin)
./scripts/overnight-plugin-enhancer.py --plugin overnight-dev

# Expected output:
# ✅ Vertex AI initialized
# ✅ Found 1 plugin
# 🔧 Processing: overnight-dev (productivity)
# 📊 Step 1: Analyzing plugin structure...
# 🎯 Step 2: Generating enhancement plan...
# 📝 Step 3: Creating comprehensive SKILL.md...
# ✨ Step 4: Applying enhancements...
# 🎉 Enhancements applied successfully!
```

## Run Overnight on All Plugins

```bash
# Start the overnight batch (estimated 6-8 hours for 236 plugins)
nohup ./scripts/overnight-plugin-enhancer.py > enhancement-log.txt 2>&1 &

# Save the process ID
echo $! > enhancement.pid

# Monitor progress in real-time
tail -f enhancement-log.txt

# Or check database
sqlite3 backups/plugin-enhancements/enhancements.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enhancements WHERE status='success'"
```

## With Limits (Testing)

```bash
# Process first 10 plugins only
./scripts/overnight-plugin-enhancer.py --limit 10

# Process first 50 plugins (2-3 hours)
./scripts/overnight-plugin-enhancer.py --limit 50
```

## Safety Features

### Automatic Backups
Every plugin is backed up before modification:
```
backups/plugin-enhancements/plugin-backups/
├── overnight-dev_20251019_235900/
├── web-to-github-issue_20251019_235935/
└── devops-automation-pack_20251020_000010/
```

### Audit Trail
All operations logged to SQLite:
```bash
# View enhancement history
sqlite3 backups/plugin-enhancements/enhancements.db

# Query successes
SELECT plugin_name, timestamp, changes_made
FROM enhancements
WHERE status='success'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

# Query failures
SELECT plugin_name, error_message
FROM enhancements
WHERE status='failed';

# Quality score improvements
SELECT plugin_name, score_before, score_after,
       (score_after - score_before) as improvement
FROM quality_scores
ORDER BY improvement DESC;
```

### Rate Limiting
Built-in conservative rate limiting to avoid quota errors:
- 35 seconds between Gemini API calls
- Ultra-conservative for free tier
- Automatic retry on transient errors (max 3 attempts)

## Expected Results

### Before Enhancement (Typical Plugin)
```
Size: 1,600 bytes
Code examples: 2-3
Workflow: 2-3 high-level steps
Bundled resources: None
Writing style: Mixed (some "you should")
Quality score: 35/100
```

### After Enhancement
```
Size: 8,500 bytes
Code examples: 12
Workflow: 5 detailed phases
Bundled resources: scripts/, references/, assets/ directories
Writing style: Pure imperative/infinitive
Quality score: 85/100
```

## Monitoring

### Check Progress
```bash
# How many processed?
sqlite3 backups/plugin-enhancements/enhancements.db \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enhancements"

# Success rate
sqlite3 backups/plugin-enhancements/enhancements.db \
  "SELECT
     COUNT(CASE WHEN status='success' THEN 1 END) as successes,
     COUNT(CASE WHEN status='failed' THEN 1 END) as failures,
     COUNT(*) as total
   FROM enhancements"

# Average quality improvement
sqlite3 backups/plugin-enhancements/enhancements.db \
  "SELECT AVG(score_after - score_before) as avg_improvement
   FROM quality_scores"
```

### Stop If Needed
```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep overnight-plugin-enhancer

# Kill gracefully
kill $(cat enhancement.pid)

# Or force kill
kill -9 $(cat enhancement.pid)
```

## Cost Estimate

**Vertex AI Gemini 2.0 Flash Pricing:**
- Input: Free (within quota)
- Output: Free (within quota)

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 2 million tokens/day input
- 50,000 tokens/day output

**Our Usage:**
- ~4,000 tokens per plugin (analysis + generation)
- 236 plugins × 4,000 tokens = 944,000 tokens
- **Well within free tier limits!**

**Ultra-Conservative Rate Limiting (Timeout-Safe):**
- 90-120 seconds between calls (randomized)
- Extra 30-60 second breaks every 10 plugins
- ~30 calls/hour maximum
- 236 plugins / 30 = ~8 hours minimum
- With retries and processing: 10-12 hours total (perfect overnight run!)

## What Gets Created

For each plugin, the enhancer creates:

1. **Enhanced SKILL.md**
   - 8,000+ bytes of comprehensive content
   - Proper YAML frontmatter (hyphen-case name, triggers)
   - Imperative/infinitive writing style
   - 4-6 workflow phases with detailed steps
   - 10-15 code examples
   - 3-5 complete usage scenarios
   - References to bundled resources

2. **Bundled Resource Directories**
   ```
   plugins/{category}/{plugin-name}/skills/skill-adapter/
   ├── SKILL.md (enhanced)
   ├── scripts/
   │   └── README.md (with TODO list)
   ├── references/
   │   └── README.md (with TODO list)
   └── assets/
       └── README.md (with TODO list)
   ```

3. **Backup**
   - Complete plugin backup before any changes
   - Timestamped for easy recovery

4. **Audit Log**
   - All changes tracked in SQLite
   - Analysis results preserved
   - Error messages captured

## After Completion

### Review Changes
```bash
# See what changed
git status

# Review specific plugin
git diff plugins/productivity/overnight-dev/

# Check SKILL.md size
wc -c plugins/*/*/skills/skill-adapter/SKILL.md | sort -n

# Count plugins with bundled resources
find plugins -type d -name scripts | wc -l
find plugins -type d -name references | wc -l
find plugins -type d -name assets | wc -l
```

### Commit Enhancements
```bash
# Stage all enhanced plugins
git add plugins/

# Create comprehensive commit
git commit -m "feat: enhance 236 plugins with Anthropic Agent Skills standards

- Expand SKILL.md content to 8,000+ bytes
- Add comprehensive workflow phases (4-6 per skill)
- Include 10-15 code examples per skill
- Create bundled resource directories (scripts/, references/, assets/)
- Convert to imperative/infinitive writing style
- Add progressive disclosure patterns
- Include 3-5 complete usage scenarios

### Update Marketplace
```bash
# Sync marketplace catalog
pnpm run sync-marketplace

# Validate everything
./scripts/validate-all.sh

# Deploy to production
git push origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Vertex AI init failed"
```bash
# Re-authenticate
gcloud auth application-default login

# Check project
gcloud config get-value project
```

### "Quota exceeded"
The script has ultra-conservative rate limiting (35s between calls) to prevent this.
If it still happens:
- Wait 24 hours (quota resets daily)
- Or upgrade to paid tier (still very cheap)

### "Enhancement failed"
Check the audit database:
```bash
sqlite3 backups/plugin-enhancements/enhancements.db \
  "SELECT plugin_name, error_message FROM enhancements WHERE status='failed'"
```

Common causes:
- Malformed plugin.json
- Missing README.md
- Invalid directory structure

Fix the plugin and run again on just that one:
```bash
./scripts/overnight-plugin-enhancer.py --plugin {plugin-name}
```

### "Generated SKILL.md is invalid"
The script validates frontmatter before saving. If generation fails:
- Gemini might have hit safety filters
- Plugin description might be confusing
- README might be too short

Check the logs for details, then retry.

## Advanced Usage

### Dry Run (Analysis Only)
```bash
# Analyze without making changes
./scripts/overnight-plugin-enhancer.py --dry-run --limit 10
```

### Custom Standards
Edit the standards document that Gemini uses:
```bash
# Edit the reference guide
vim claudes-docs/anthropic-agent-skills-complete-reference.md

# Gemini will use the updated standards on next run
```

### Parallel Processing (Risky!)
By default, runs sequentially to respect rate limits. For faster processing (if you have paid tier):

Edit `scripts/overnight-plugin-enhancer.py`:
```python
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 5.0  # Reduce from 35s to 5s (paid tier)
```

---

## Ready to Run?

```bash
# Test on one plugin first
./scripts/overnight-plugin-enhancer.py --plugin overnight-dev

# If that works, run overnight batch
nohup ./scripts/overnight-plugin-enhancer.py > enhancement-log.txt 2>&1 &

# Go to bed, wake up to 236 enhanced plugins! 🌙
```

**Pro tip:** Run this on a Friday night. Wake up Saturday morning to fully enhanced plugins, review during the weekend, commit on Monday.

**Questions?** Check the audit database, review backups, or examine the logs.

**Emergency rollback?** All backups are timestamped in `backups/plugin-enhancements/plugin-backups/`
