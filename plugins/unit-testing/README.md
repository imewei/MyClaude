# 4. Tests with logging (confirms interleaving)
# 5. Isolates root cause (missing lock)

# 8. Prevents recurrence (adds documentation, stress test)
```

## Key Features

### Systematic Debugging Process

The debugger agent follows an 8-step workflow:
1. **Capture Context** - Errors, logs, traces, environment
2. **Reproduce Issue** - Minimal reproduction case
3. **Form Hypotheses** - Ranked list of potential causes
4. **Test Systematically** - Validate each hypothesis
5. **Isolate Root Cause** - Pinpoint exact failure
6. **Implement Fix** - Minimal, targeted solution
7. **Verify Resolution** - Comprehensive validation
8. **Prevent Recurrence** - Tests, monitoring, documentation

### Systematic Test Automation Process

The test-automator agent follows an 8-step workflow:
1. **Analyze Requirements** - Objectives, scope, risk areas
2. **Design Strategy** - Framework selection, test pyramid
3. **Implement Automation** - Scalable, maintainable tests
4. **Integrate CI/CD** - Automated execution, quality gates
5. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Happy paths, edge cases, negative tests
6. **Monitoring & Reporting** - Dashboards, flaky test detection
7. **Optimize Performance** - Parallel execution, sharding
8. **Plan Maintenance** - Documentation, contribution guidelines

### Quality Assurance Checkpoints

**debugger principles:**
- Root Cause Identified (not symptoms)
- Evidence-Based diagnosis
- Minimal Fix approach
- Test Coverage for prevention
- No Regressions
- Performance maintained
- Documentation complete
- Monitoring improved

**test-automator principles:**
- Test Coverage (critical paths)
- Test Reliability (>99% stability)
- Test Speed (<10 min)
- Test Maintainability (DRY)
- Test Clarity (descriptive names)
- Test Isolation (independent)
- Test Value (behavior, not implementation)
- CI/CD Integration (automated)

### Strategic Ambiguity Handling

**debugger questions (16 across 4 domains):**
- Error Context & Environment

- System State & Dependencies
- Impact & Urgency

**test-automator questions (16 across 4 domains):**

### Common Patterns Library

**debugger patterns:**
- Binary Search Debugging (git bisect, divide-and-conquer)
- Log Correlation Analysis (distributed tracing timeline)
- Performance Profiling Investigation (flame graphs, hotspots)

**test-automator patterns:**
- Page Object Model for UI Tests (encapsulation, maintainability)
- Test Data Factories and Fixtures (consistency, cleanup)
- TDD Red-Green-Refactor Cycle (test-first development)

## Quick Start

To use this plugin:

1. Ensure Claude Code is installed
2. Enable the `unit-testing` plugin
3. Activate an agent (e.g., `@debugger` or `@test-automator`)
4. Try a command (e.g., `/test-generate` or `/run-all-tests`)

**Example debugging workflow:**
```bash
# Activate debugger agent
@debugger

# Ask for help with failing test
"This test fails intermittently in CI with 'expected 3, got 2'.
It involves concurrent threads incrementing a counter."

# The agent will:
# 1. Capture full context (test code, CI logs, frequency)
# 2. Form hypothesis (race condition in increment)
# 3. Design experiment (add logging to confirm)
# 4. Identify root cause (missing synchronization)
# 5. Implement minimal fix (add threading.Lock)
# 6. Verify with stress test (1000 runs)
# 7. Prevent recurrence (documentation + stress test)
```

**Example test automation workflow:**
```bash
# Activate test-automator agent
@test-automator

# Ask for comprehensive test suite
"Generate E2E tests for user authentication flow with page objects"

# The agent will:
# 1. Analyze requirements (login, error handling, navigation)
# 2. Design strategy (Playwright, Page Object pattern)
# 3. Create page objects (LoginPage, DashboardPage)
# 4. Implement tests (success, errors, edge cases)
# 5. Add CI/CD integration (parallel execution)
# 6. Set up monitoring (flaky test detection)
```
