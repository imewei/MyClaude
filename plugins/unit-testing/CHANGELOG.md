## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-31

### Added - Agent Enhancements

#### debugger Agent (31 → 604 lines, +573 lines)

**Comprehensive Systematic Process:**
- **8-Step Debugging Workflow**: Complete systematic process with self-verification
  1. Capture Comprehensive Context
  2. Reproduce the Issue Reliably
  3. Form and Prioritize Hypotheses
  4. Test Hypotheses Systematically
  5. Isolate Root Cause with Evidence
  6. Implement Minimal, Targeted Fix
  7. Verify Resolution Comprehensively
  8. Prevent Future Occurrences

**Advanced Capabilities Added:**
- AI-Driven Root Cause Analysis with LLM-powered error pattern recognition
- Automated Log Correlation across multi-source distributed systems
- Observability and Tracing Integration (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Modern Debugging Tools (time-travel debugging, memory analysis, profiling)
- Test Failure Analysis with flaky test detection
- Programming Language Debugging (Python, JS/TS, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++)
- Distributed System Debugging (microservices, network partitions, message queues)
- Performance Debugging (CPU profiling, memory leaks, I/O bottlenecks)

**Quality Assurance Framework:**
- 8 Constitutional AI Checkpoints for validation
  1. Root Cause Identified (not just symptoms)
  2. Evidence-Based diagnosis
  3. Minimal Fix approach
  4. Test Coverage for regression prevention
  5. No Regressions introduced
  6. Performance maintained
  7. Documentation complete
  8. Monitoring improved

**Strategic Ambiguity Handling:**
- 16 Questions across 4 domains:
  - Error Context & Environment (4 questions)
  - Reproduction & Frequency (4 questions)
  - System State & Dependencies (4 questions)
  - Impact & Urgency (4 questions)

**Comprehensive Examples:**
- **Good Example**: Systematic debugging of intermittent test failure with race condition
  - Shows complete 8-step process
  - Threading issue with lost updates
  - Evidence gathering with logging
  - Fix with proper synchronization
  - Stress testing validation

- **Bad Example**: Common debugging antipatterns
  - Fixing symptoms instead of root cause
  - Spray-and-pray logging
  - Changing multiple things simultaneously
  - Silently swallowing errors

- **Annotated Example**: Distributed system log correlation
  - API 500 errors traced to database timeout
  - Distributed tracing with Jaeger
  - Database index missing causing table scan
  - 417× performance improvement after fix
  - Monitoring alerts added for prevention

**Common Patterns:**
- Pattern 1: Binary Search Debugging (git bisect, code path narrowing)
- Pattern 2: Log Correlation Analysis (multi-service timeline reconstruction)
- Pattern 3: Performance Profiling Investigation (flame graphs, hotspot analysis)

#### test-automator Agent (204 → 871 lines, +667 lines)

**Comprehensive Systematic Process:**
- **8-Step Test Automation Workflow**: Complete systematic process with self-verification
  1. Analyze Testing Requirements and Scope
  2. Design Comprehensive Test Strategy
  3. Implement Scalable Test Automation
  4. Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline
  5. Implement Comprehensive Test Coverage
  6. Establish Monitoring and Reporting
  7. Optimize for Speed and Reliability
  8. Plan for Maintenance and Evolution

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- Test-Driven Development Excellence with red-green-refactor mastery
- AI-Powered Testing Frameworks (self-healing, ML-driven optimization)
- Modern Test Automation Frameworks (Playwright, pytest, Jest, Cypress)
- Low-Code/No-Code Testing Platforms (Testsigma, Mabl, Katalon)
- CI/CD Testing Integration with parallel execution
- Performance and Load Testing at scale
- Test Data Management and Security
- Quality Engineering Strategy with test pyramid optimization
- Cross-Platform Testing (browsers, mobile, desktop, API)
- Advanced Testing Techniques (chaos engineering, contract testing, property-based)
- Test Reporting and Analytics with trend analysis

**Quality Assurance Framework:**
- 8 Constitutional AI Checkpoints for validation
  1. Test Coverage (critical paths tested)
  2. Test Reliability (>99% stability)
  3. Test Speed (<10 min for full suite)
  4. Test Maintainability (DRY, abstractions)
  5. Test Clarity (descriptive names)
  6. Test Isolation (independent, parallel)
  7. Test Value (behavior, not implementation)
  8. CI/CD Integration (automated feedback)

**Strategic Ambiguity Handling:**
- 16 Questions across 4 domains:
  - Testing Scope & Requirements (4 questions)
  - Test Framework & Tools (4 questions)
  - Test Environment & Data (4 questions)
  - Success Criteria & Constraints (4 questions)

**Comprehensive Examples:**
- **Good Example**: E2E test with Page Object Pattern (Playwright/TypeScript)
  - Complete LoginPage and DashboardPage objects
  - Data-testid selectors for stability
  - Arrange-Act-Assert structure
  - Test isolation with beforeEach
  - Success and failure scenarios

- **Bad Example**: Common test automation antipatterns
  - Hardcoded URLs and brittle selectors
  - Test dependencies breaking isolation
  - Testing implementation details
  - Hard-coded waits instead of smart waiting
  - Weak assertions

- **Annotated Example**: TDD cycle with property-based testing
  - Email validation function implementation
  - Red-Green-Refactor process
  - Hypothesis property-based testing
  - Edge cases found automatically (consecutive dots)
  - 100% coverage with 200+ generated test cases
  - TDD metrics: 15 min cycle time, 2 bugs found

**Common Patterns:**
- Pattern 1: Page Object Model for UI Tests (Playwright, Selenium, Cypress)
- Pattern 2: Test Data Factories and Fixtures (pytest fixtures with cleanup)
- Pattern 3: TDD Red-Green-Refactor Cycle (systematic test-first development)
