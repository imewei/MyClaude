  "description": "Scientific code modernization with comprehensive legacy-to-modern framework migration. Specializes in Fortran/C/MATLAB to Python/JAX/Julia migrations while preserving numerical accuracy and achieving GPU acceleration. Features execution modes, external documentation, and systematic migration workflows.",
  "changelog": "v1.0.3: Command optimization with hub-and-spoke architecture achieving enhanced workflow efficiency through external documentation (~2,400 lines across 6 files). Added execution modes (quick/standard/comprehensive) for flexible time/scope control. Enhanced plugin.json with comprehensive metadata including capabilities, triggers, and execution modes. Created detailed CHANGELOG.md documenting all improvements. Updated README.md with new capabilities and optimization metrics. Maintains 100% backward compatibility with v1.0.2.",
