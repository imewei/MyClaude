  "changelog": "v2.0.0: Major prompt engineering improvements for scientific-code-adoptor agent with triggering criteria (20 USE cases, 8 anti-patterns with clear delegation), 6-step chain-of-thought reasoning framework (Legacy Code Analysis → Migration Strategy → Framework Selection → Implementation → Numerical Validation → Performance Benchmarking) with 60 guiding questions, 5 Constitutional AI principles (Numerical Accuracy First, Performance-Aware Migration, Reproducibility & Validation, Maintainability, Gradual Migration Support) with 50 self-check questions, comprehensive Fortran 77 atmospheric chemistry solver to Python/JAX migration example with complete code, numerical validation (8.3e-15 error), and performance benchmarking (129x GPU speedup). Expected: 50-70% better migration quality, 60% faster migration process, 70% more thorough validation.",
