# JAX Core Programming References

Detailed reference documentation for JAX ecosystem components.

## Reference Files

These reference files provide deep dives into specific JAX topics:

- **jax_transformations.md**: Comprehensive guide to jit, vmap, pmap, grad with composition patterns
- **flax_nnx_guide.md**: Flax NNX module patterns, training strategies, and state management
- **optax_optimizers.md**: Complete optimizer catalog with composition patterns
- **orbax_checkpointing.md**: Advanced checkpoint strategies and disaster recovery
- **numpyro_bayesian.md**: Bayesian modeling patterns with NumPyro
- **performance_optimization.md**: Memory optimization, profiling, and multi-device scaling

## Usage

Claude will load these reference files as needed when working on specific JAX tasks. The main SKILL.md provides core workflows and patterns, while these references offer detailed technical information.

For comprehensive NumPyro expertise, also refer to the `numpyro-core-mastery` skill.
