Physics Validation Checklists - Quick Reference
================================================

MOLECULAR DYNAMICS QUICK CHECKS
--------------------------------

Energy Conservation (NVE):
  ✓ Plot E_total vs time → should be flat line
  ✓ Compute drift: |E_final - E_initial| / E_initial < 0.0001
  ✓ Check E_kinetic + E_potential = E_total (balance)

Temperature (NVT):
  ✓ Target T = 1.0 → Actual T = 1.0 ± 0.01
  ✓ Histogram of T → Gaussian distribution
  ✓ Autocorrelation → exponential decay (no oscillations)

Structural:
  ✓ g(r) first peak at r ≈ 2^(1/6)σ (LJ minimum)
  ✓ Coordination number ≈ 12 (FCC) or 8 (BCC)
  ✓ No particles with r < 0.9σ (overlap check)


CFD QUICK CHECKS
----------------

Mass Conservation:
  ✓ ∇·u = 0 everywhere (incompressible)
  ✓ |∇·u|_max < 1e-10
  ✓ Integrate flux through boundaries = 0

Benchmark Tests:
  ✓ Poiseuille flow: u_max = 1.5·u_avg
  ✓ Lid-driven cavity: Primary vortex at (0.5, 0.6)
  ✓ Taylor-Green: E(t) = E₀·exp(-2νk²t)

Stability:
  ✓ CFL = u·Δt/Δx < 1.0
  ✓ Diffusion number = ν·Δt/Δx² < 0.5
  ✓ No checkerboard patterns


PINN QUICK CHECKS
-----------------

PDE Residual:
  ✓ Mean |R_PDE| < 0.001
  ✓ Max |R_PDE| < 0.01
  ✓ Plot residual heatmap → no hot spots

Boundary Conditions:
  ✓ Dirichlet: |u - u_BC| < 1e-5
  ✓ Neumann: |∂u/∂n - g| < 1e-4
  ✓ Periodic: u(0) = u(L) exactly

Training:
  ✓ Loss decreasing monotonically
  ✓ Validation loss not diverging
  ✓ Gradients: 1e-6 < |∇L| < 1 (not vanishing/exploding)


QUANTUM VQE QUICK CHECKS
------------------------

Energy:
  ✓ E_VQE < E_exact_diagonalization
  ✓ E_VQE variational (monotonically decreasing)
  ✓ |E_VQE - E_exact| < 1 mHa (chemical accuracy)

Circuit:
  ✓ Parameter gradients non-zero
  ✓ Entanglement entropy > 0 (state not product state)
  ✓ Circuit depth < device coherence limit

State:
  ✓ ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1.0 ± 1e-10 (normalization)
  ✓ All measurement probabilities ∈ [0,1]


MULTI-PHYSICS QUICK CHECKS
---------------------------

Interface:
  ✓ Continuous solution: u_left(interface) = u_right(interface)
  ✓ Flux balance: q_left = q_right
  ✓ No discontinuous jumps in solution

Conservation:
  ✓ Global energy: ∫E dV = constant
  ✓ Global mass: ∫ρ dV = constant
  ✓ Momentum transfer balanced


COMMON RED FLAGS
----------------

MD:
  🚩 Energy increasing over time → timestep too large
  🚩 Temperature oscillating → thermostat tau too small
  🚩 Particles escaping box → force calculation bug
  🚩 RDF has no structure → system not equilibrated

CFD:
  🚩 Velocity increasing unbounded → instability
  🚩 Checkerboard pressure field → use staggered grid
  🚩 ∇·u = 1e-5 → pressure solver not converged
  🚩 Vortices at wrong location → boundary conditions wrong

PINN:
  🚩 Loss plateaus early → learning rate too small or too large
  🚩 One loss term >> others → weight imbalance
  🚩 Solution smooth but wrong → network not expressive enough
  🚩 Solution oscillatory → over-parameterized, use regularization

VQE:
  🚩 Energy > ground state → barren plateau (gradients vanishing)
  🚩 Energy not decreasing → optimizer stuck in local minimum
  🚩 Variance large → circuit not converged, need more layers


VALIDATION WORKFLOW
