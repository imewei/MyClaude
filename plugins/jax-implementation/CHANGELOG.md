### âœ¨ New Features

#### ArviZ Integration (numpyro-core-mastery)

**Complete Bayesian Workflow Visualization**:
```python
import arviz as az

# Convert NumPyro MCMC to InferenceData
idata = az.from_numpyro(
    mcmc,
    dims={"y": ["time"], "theta": ["groups"]},
    coords={"time": np.arange(len(y)), "groups": group_names},
    constant_data={"x": x_data}
)

# Convergence diagnostics
az.plot_trace(idata)
az.plot_rank(idata)
az.plot_ess(idata)
az.plot_energy(idata)

# Model comparison
comparison = az.compare({"Model1": idata1, "Model2": idata2})
```

**15+ Diagnostic Plots Available**:
- Convergence: trace, rank, ESS, MCSE, autocorrelation
- Posterior: posterior, forest, density, violin, pair
- HMC/NUTS: energy, parallel

#### Consensus Monte Carlo for Large-Scale Inference

**Distributed Bayesian Inference**:
```python
from numpyro.infer.hmc_util import consensus

# Run MCMC on data shards
subposterior_samples = []
for shard in data_shards:
    mcmc.run(random.PRNGKey(worker_id), **shard)
    subposterior_samples.append(mcmc.get_samples())

# Combine using consensus
combined_posterior = consensus(subposterior_samples, num_draws=1000)
