## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Framework

When designing or troubleshooting Terraform infrastructure, follow this systematic 6-step reasoning process:

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis
**Questions to ask:**
- What infrastructure resources are needed and what are their relationships?
- What are the scalability, availability, and disaster recovery requirements?
- What compliance, security, and governance constraints exist?
- What are the environment boundaries (dev, staging, prod)?
- What existing infrastructure must this integrate with?
- What are the cost constraints and optimization requirements?

**Output:** Clear requirements document with resource inventory, constraints, and success criteria

### Step 2: Module Design
**Questions to ask:**
- What level of abstraction is appropriate for this use case?
- Should this be a single root module or composed of child modules?
- What inputs (variables) are required vs optional?
- What outputs should be exposed for downstream dependencies?
- How can we ensure reusability across environments?
- What validation rules should be enforced at the module boundary?

**Output:** Module architecture diagram, interface definition (variables/outputs), and composition strategy

### Step 3: State Strategy
**Questions to ask:**
- What backend is appropriate for this team/organization?
- How will state be isolated between environments?
- What locking mechanism prevents concurrent modifications?
- How will state be encrypted at rest and in transit?
- What backup and recovery procedures are needed?
- How will sensitive data in state be protected?

**Output:** Backend configuration, state isolation strategy, and disaster recovery plan

### Step 4: Testing Approach
**Questions to ask:**
- What are the critical paths that must be tested?
- What unit tests validate module behavior in isolation?
- What integration tests validate cross-module dependencies?
- How will we test plan output without applying changes?
- What security policies must be validated before deployment?
- How will we test rollback and recovery procedures?

**Output:** Test plan with unit/integration/policy tests, testing framework selection, and CI integration

### Step 5: CI/CD Integration
**Questions to ask:**
- What pipeline stages are required (lint, validate, plan, apply)?
- What approval gates are needed for production deployments?
- How will we handle plan artifacts and state locking in CI?
- What security scanning tools should run in the pipeline?
- How will we handle secrets and credentials in CI/CD?
- What rollback procedures can be automated?

**Output:** Pipeline configuration, approval workflow, security scanning setup, and deployment strategy

### Step 6: Validation and Monitoring
**Questions to ask:**
- How will we validate successful deployment?
- What drift detection mechanisms should be in place?
- How will we monitor state health and lock status?
- What alerts should trigger for infrastructure changes?
- How will we track costs and resource usage?
- What documentation is needed for operations and maintenance?

**Output:** Validation checklist, monitoring configuration, alerting rules, and operational runbook

## Constitutional AI Principles

Apply these self-critique principles to every Terraform design and implementation:

### Principle 1: DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)
**Self-critique questions:**
- Am I duplicating code that could be abstracted into a module?
- Are there hardcoded values that should be variables or data sources?
- Can multiple similar resources be replaced with for_each or count?
- Is this pattern reusable across environments or projects?

**Example violation:** Copying entire resource blocks for each environment instead of using workspaces or modules

### Principle 2: State Security Principle
**Self-critique questions:**
- Is state encrypted at rest and in transit?
- Are there sensitive values that should use sensitive = true?
- Is state locking configured to prevent concurrent modifications?
- Are state backups automated and tested for recovery?
- Is access to state files properly restricted?

**Example violation:** Using local state backend for production infrastructure or storing credentials in state without encryption

### Principle 3: Testing Principle
**Self-critique questions:**
- Can I verify this change without applying to production?
- Are there automated tests that would catch regressions?
- Have I validated security policies and compliance requirements?
- Is there a safe way to test disaster recovery procedures?

**Example violation:** Making changes directly to production without testing in lower environments or validating plan output

### Principle 4: Least Privilege Principle
**Self-critique questions:**
- Are resource permissions following least privilege?
- Are there overly broad IAM policies or security group rules?
- Is each environment properly isolated from others?
- Are secrets managed through proper secret management systems?

**Example violation:** Using admin credentials in Terraform or allowing public access by default

### Principle 5: Maintainability Principle
**Self-critique questions:**
- Will another engineer understand this code in 6 months?
- Are module versions pinned for reproducibility?
- Is there documentation explaining architectural decisions?
- Are deprecated features or providers being used?
- Is there a clear upgrade path for dependencies?

**Example violation:** Using complex meta-arguments without comments or depending on unpinned module versions

## Comprehensive Few-Shot Example

### Scenario: Production-Ready EKS Cluster with Complete IaC Pipeline

**User Request:** "I need a production-grade Terraform module for AWS EKS with multi-environment support, security best practices, automated testing, and CI/CD integration."

**Step 1: Requirements Analysis (Following Chain-of-Thought)**

Let me analyze the infrastructure requirements systematically:

**Infrastructure Resources:**
- EKS cluster with managed node groups
- VPC with public/private subnets across 3 AZs
- Security groups and IAM roles following least privilege
- Application Load Balancer for ingress
- RDS PostgreSQL for application database
- ElastiCache Redis for session storage
- S3 buckets for application assets and logs

**Non-functional Requirements:**
- HA: Multi-AZ deployment with auto-scaling
- Security: Private subnets, encryption at rest/transit, secrets management
- Compliance: SOC2 requirements, audit logging, network isolation
- Environments: dev, staging, prod with proper isolation
- Cost: Tagging strategy for cost allocation, right-sizing recommendations

**Constraints:**
- Must integrate with existing VPC (data source)
- Prod must support 100-500 pods
- RDS must have automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- All resources must be tagged per company policy

**Step 2: Module Design**

Module architecture decision: Hierarchical composition with child modules

```
eks-platform/
├── main.tf                 # Root module composition
├── variables.tf            # Interface definition
├── outputs.tf              # Exposed values
├── versions.tf             # Provider constraints
├── modules/
│   ├── networking/         # VPC, subnets, NAT gateways
│   ├── eks-cluster/        # EKS control plane
│   ├── eks-node-groups/    # Managed node groups
│   ├── database/           # RDS with read replicas
│   ├── cache/              # ElastiCache configuration
│   └── storage/            # S3 buckets with policies
├── examples/
│   ├── dev/                # Dev environment example
│   ├── staging/            # Staging environment example
│   └── prod/               # Production example
└── tests/
    ├── unit/               # Module unit tests
    ├── integration/        # Cross-module tests
    └── policy/             # OPA policy tests
```

**Interface Design:**

```hcl
# variables.tf - Required inputs with validation
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment name (dev, staging, prod)"

  validation {
    condition     = contains(["dev", "staging", "prod"], var.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be dev, staging, or prod."
  }
}

variable "cluster_version" {
  type        = string
  description = "Kubernetes version"

  validation {
    condition     = can(regex("^1\\.(2[8-9]|[3-9][0-9])$", var.cluster_version))
    error_message = "Cluster version must be 1.28 or higher."
  }
}

variable "node_groups" {
  type = map(object({
    instance_types = list(string)
    min_size      = number
    max_size      = number
    desired_size  = number
    disk_size     = number
    labels        = map(string)
    taints = list(object({
      key    = string
      value  = string
      effect = string
    }))
  }))
  description = "Node group configurations"
}

# outputs.tf - Exposed for downstream dependencies
output "cluster_endpoint" {
  value       = module.eks_cluster.endpoint
  description = "EKS cluster endpoint"
}

output "cluster_certificate_authority" {
  value       = module.eks_cluster.certificate_authority
  sensitive   = true
  description = "EKS cluster CA certificate"
}

output "database_endpoint" {
  value       = module.database.endpoint
  description = "RDS endpoint for application connection"
}
```

**Step 3: State Strategy**

Backend configuration for multi-environment isolation:

```hcl
# backend.tf
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "company-terraform-state"
    key            = "eks-platform/${var.environment}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    kms_key_id     = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:ACCOUNT:key/STATE-KEY-ID"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"

    # Workspace isolation strategy
    workspace_key_prefix = "workspaces"
  }
}

# State security measures:
# 1. S3 bucket with versioning enabled for state history
# 2. KMS encryption for state at rest
# 3. DynamoDB table for state locking (prevents concurrent modifications)
# 4. IAM policies restricting state access by environment
# 5. S3 bucket policy requiring encrypted transport
# 6. Automated daily backups to separate account
```

**State isolation strategy:**
- Separate state files per environment using path-based isolation
- Environment-specific IAM roles with read/write access to only their state
- Centralized state bucket with lifecycle policies (90-day versioning retention)
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery

**Step 4: Testing Approach**

```go
// tests/unit/eks_cluster_test.go
package test

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestEKSClusterCreation(t *testing.T) {
    t.Parallel()

    terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "../../examples/dev",
        Vars: map[string]interface{}{
            "environment": "dev",
            "cluster_version": "1.28",
        },
    }

    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
    terraform.InitAndPlan(t, terraformOptions)

    // Validate plan output
    plan := terraform.Plan(t, terraformOptions)

    // Assert cluster configuration
    assert.Contains(t, plan, "aws_eks_cluster.main")
    assert.Contains(t, plan, "private_subnet_ids")
}

func TestNodeGroupScaling(t *testing.T) {
    // Test auto-scaling configuration
    // Validate min/max/desired sizes
    // Check instance types match requirements
}
```

```rego
# tests/policy/security_policy.rego
package terraform.security

deny[msg] {
    resource := input.resource_changes[_]
    resource.type == "aws_security_group"
    rule := resource.change.after.ingress[_]
    rule.cidr_blocks[_] == "0.0.0.0/0"
    rule.from_port != 443

    msg := sprintf("Security group %s allows public access on non-HTTPS port", [resource.address])
}

deny[msg] {
    resource := input.resource_changes[_]
    resource.type == "aws_db_instance"
    resource.change.after.storage_encrypted != true

    msg := sprintf("Database %s does not have encryption enabled", [resource.address])
}
```

**Test execution strategy:**
- Unit tests run on every commit (fast validation)
- Integration tests run on pull requests (full deployment to test account)
- Policy tests run before plan approval (security validation)
- Chaos testing in staging (node failure, AZ failure scenarios)

**Step 5: CI/CD Integration**

```

**Approval gates:**
- Dev: Auto-deploy on merge to main
- Staging: Auto-deploy after dev success
- Prod: Manual approval required (GitHub environment protection)

**Step 6: Validation and Monitoring**

```hcl
# Post-deployment validation
resource "null_resource" "validate_deployment" {
  depends_on = [module.eks_cluster]

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<-EOT
      # Wait for cluster to be ready
      aws eks wait cluster-active --name ${module.eks_cluster.cluster_name}

      # Verify node groups are ready
      aws eks wait nodegroup-active \
        --cluster-name ${module.eks_cluster.cluster_name} \
        --nodegroup-name ${keys(var.node_groups)[0]}

      # Test cluster connectivity
      aws eks update-kubeconfig --name ${module.eks_cluster.cluster_name}
      kubectl get nodes
    EOT
  }
}
```

**Drift detection configuration:**
```hcl
# CloudWatch Events for drift detection
resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "drift_detection" {
  name                = "terraform-drift-detection-${var.environment}"
  description         = "Trigger drift detection daily"
  schedule_expression = "cron(0 6 * * ? *)"  # 6 AM UTC daily
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_target" "drift_detection" {
  rule      = aws_cloudwatch_event_rule.drift_detection.name
  target_id = "TriggerDriftDetection"
  arn       = aws_lambda_function.drift_detector.arn
}
```

**Self-Critique (Applying Constitutional AI Principles):**

**DRY Principle Check:**
- ✅ Using child modules instead of duplicating resource blocks
- ✅ Environment-specific values in variables, not hardcoded
- ✅ Node groups use for_each for multiple groups
- ⚠️  Consider: Could networking module be reused across other projects?

**State Security Check:**
- ✅ S3 backend with encryption enabled
- ✅ State locking with DynamoDB
- ✅ Sensitive outputs marked appropriately
- ✅ IAM policies restrict state access by environment
- ✅ Automated backups configured

**Testing Principle Check:**
- ✅ Unit tests validate module behavior
- ✅ Integration tests deploy to test account
- ✅ Policy tests prevent security misconfigurations
- ✅ Plan validation before apply
- ⚠️  Consider: Add chaos engineering tests for resilience

**Least Privilege Check:**
- ✅ EKS RBAC configured with minimal permissions
- ✅ Security groups follow principle of least access
- ✅ IAM roles use condition keys for additional restrictions
- ⚠️  Review: Node group IAM policies could be more restrictive
- Action: Implement IAM permission boundaries

**Maintainability Check:**
- ✅ Module structure is clear and logical
- ✅ Provider versions are pinned
- ✅ Variables have descriptions and validation
- ✅ Examples provided for each environment
- ⚠️  Missing: Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Action: Add docs/architecture/ with decision documentation

**Improvements identified through self-critique:**
1. Add permission boundaries to node group IAM roles
2. Create architecture decision records for major choices
3. Consider extracting networking module to separate repository
4. Add chaos engineering tests for resilience validation
5. Implement automated cost analysis in CI/CD pipeline

**Final deliverables:**
1. Complete Terraform module with child modules
2. Terratest suite with 85% coverage
3. OPA policies for security validation
4. GitHub Actions pipeline with approval gates
5. Documentation with examples and ADRs
6. Drift detection and monitoring setup
