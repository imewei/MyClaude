## Examples

### Example 1: Multi-Region Web Application Architecture

**Request:** "Design a highly available web application on AWS with multi-region failover"

**cloud-architect v2.0.0 Response:**
```
## Step 1: Requirements Analysis
- Availability target: 99.99% (52 minutes downtime/year)
- Traffic: 1000 req/sec peak
- Multi-region: Primary (us-east-1), Secondary (us-west-2)

## Step 2: Service Selection
Primary Services:
- ALB (Application Load Balancer) - $16.43/month per region
- ECS Fargate - Auto-scaling containers
- RDS Multi-AZ PostgreSQL - Cross-region replication
- ElastiCache Redis - Session management
- S3 + CloudFront - Static assets with edge caching

## Step 3: Architecture Design
[Complete architecture YAML provided]

## Step 4: Cost Optimization
Monthly Cost: $3,321
- Compute: $1,800 (reserved instances: -$540/month savings)
- Database: $450 (Multi-AZ: necessary for availability)
- Networking: $600 (CloudFront reduces origin traffic)
- Storage: $250

## Step 5: Security Review
- VPC with private subnets for app/database tiers
- WAF rules for common vulnerabilities
- TLS 1.3 enforced via CloudFront
- Secrets Manager for credentials rotation

## Step 6: Validation
‚úì Meets 99.99% availability target
‚úì Auto-scales 100-1000 instances
‚úì RTO: 5 minutes (DNS failover)
‚úì RPO: 5 minutes (RDS replication lag)

[Complete Terraform implementation provided]
```

### Example 3: SEV-1 API Outage Debugging

**Request:** "API endpoints are returning 500 errors with high memory usage"

**devops-troubleshooter v2.0.0 Response:**
```
## T+0m - Incident Assessment (SEV-1)
Severity: SEV-1 (100% API unavailability)
Affected: All API endpoints
Impact: 10,000 active users
Scope: Production cluster (us-east-1)

## T+5m - Data Gathering
Prometheus Alert: pod_memory_usage > 90% for 5m
kubectl top pods:
  api-deployment-abc123: 7.8Gi / 8Gi (98% memory)

Logs show: "runtime: out of memory"

## T+10m - Hypothesis Formation
Primary: Memory leak in request processing
Evidence: Memory growth correlates with request count
Alternative: Memory limit too low (ruled out: 8Gi is appropriate)

## T+15m - Testing & Validation
Go pprof analysis:
- 6.2 GB allocated by middleware.LogRequest
- []byte slices never released
- Goroutine leak: 45,000 active (expected: <1000)

## T+25m - Implementation
Fix applied to middleware/logging.go:
[Code diff showing proper buffer pooling]

Deployed via rolling update
Memory usage: 98% ‚Üí 45% within 2 minutes

## T+55m - Postmortem
Root Cause: Logging middleware allocated []byte for every request without releasing
Action Items:
1. Add memory profiling to staging (OWNER: SRE, DUE: 2025-02-05)
2. Implement buffer pooling pattern (OWNER: Backend, DUE: 2025-02-07)
3. Add memory leak detection alerts (OWNER: SRE, DUE: 2025-02-10)

[Complete debugging trace with Prometheus queries and code fixes provided]
```
