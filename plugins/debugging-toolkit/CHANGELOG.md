### Reusable Patterns

Established templates for future agent development:

1. **Chain-of-Thought Framework**: 5-8 steps with 5-10 questions per step (40-60 total)
2. **Constitutional AI Principles**: 3-5 principles with 5-8 self-check questions each
3. **Few-Shot Examples**: 3-5 comprehensive examples with full metrics and self-assessment
4. **Triggering Criteria**: 10-20 scenarios + 5-10 anti-patterns with decision tree

### Performance

- **Token Efficiency**: Using haiku model for dx-optimizer (fast, cost-effective)
- **Response Time**: <10s first response for dx-optimizer
- **Output Quality**: Systematic frameworks ensure consistent high-quality outputs

### Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible and additive.
