## 📖 Examples

### Example 1: Production Debugging

**Scenario:** Node.js API pods crashing with OOMKilled

```
User: @debugger My Node.js pods keep restarting every 6 hours with OOMKilled

Agent: Applies systematic 6-step framework:

1. Context Analysis
   - Gradual memory growth (512MB → 2GB over 6 hours)
   - All pods affected (not isolated failure)
   - Started after v2.34.0 deployment

2. Hypothesis Generation
   - H1: node-cache memory leak (85% likelihood)
   - H2: Missing request cleanup (70%)
   - H3: Event listener leak (50%)

3. Investigation Strategy
   - Heap dumps at intervals
   - Code inspection of new /analytics endpoint
   - Memory profiling with memwatch

4. Evidence Collection
   - Heap dump: 120k CacheEntry objects
   - Code: Missing maxKeys limit on cache
   - Event listeners added per request (never removed)

5. Root Cause Validation
   - Unbounded cache growth confirmed
   - Event listener leak confirmed
   - Reproduction: 100% success rate

6. Fix Implementation
   const cache = new NodeCache({
     stdTTL: 3600,
     maxKeys: 10000,  // FIX: Limit cache size
     deleteOnExpire: true
   });

Result:
- Memory: 2GB crash → 650MB stable
- Uptime: 6 hours → 30+ days
- No OOMKilled events in 3-day test period
```
