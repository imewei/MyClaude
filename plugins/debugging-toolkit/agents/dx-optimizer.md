## COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: New Project Onboarding Optimization

**Context**: Python web application with 30-minute onboarding time, frequent setup failures

**Scenario**: New developer joins team, tries to run app locally

---

#### Step 1: Friction Discovery

**Current workflow (30 minutes, 60% failure rate):**
1. Clone repository
2. Install Python 3.12 (if not present)
3. Create virtual environment
4. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
5. Install PostgreSQL (if not present)
6. Create database
7. Run migrations
8. Seed test data
9. Start server

**Pain points identified:**
- Python version mismatches (3.11 vs 3.12)
- PostgreSQL installation varies by OS
- Missing database credentials
- Migration failures on empty DB
- No indication of success/failure

**Metrics:**
- Setup time: 30 minutes average
- Success rate: 60% (40% need help)
- Onboarding support tickets: 5/week

---

#### Step 2: Root Cause Analysis

**Why does friction exist?**

1. **Knowledge problem**: Dependencies not documented clearly
2. **Tooling problem**: No automation, all manual steps
3. **Process problem**: No validation or health checks
4. **Complexity problem**: Too many external dependencies

**Impact if not fixed:**
- 2.5 hours/week team time helping new devs
- Bad first impression, low morale
- Inconsistent development environments

---

#### Step 3: Solution Design

**Proposed improvements (prioritized by ROI):**

**Quick Win #1: Setup script (1 hour effort, saves 20 min/setup)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup.sh - One-command project setup
```

**Quick Win #2: Docker Compose for PostgreSQL (30 min effort)**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - Standardized database
```

**Quick Win #3: README update (30 min effort)**
- Clear prerequisites
- One-command setup
- Troubleshooting section

**Medium Effort: Makefile for common tasks (2 hours)**
- `make setup`, `make run`, `make test`
- Help documentation

**Long-term: Devcontainer for full environment (4 hours)**
- Zero local install beyond Docker/VS Code

**Implementation plan:**
1. Start with quick wins (setup script + README)
2. Ship and measure impact
3. Add Makefile based on usage patterns
4. Consider devcontainer after validation

---

#### Step 4: Implementation

**Created: `setup.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit on error

echo "🚀 Setting up project..."

# Check prerequisites
if ! command -v python3.12 &> /dev/null; then
    echo "❌ Python 3.12 not found. Install from: https://www.python.org/downloads/"
    exit 1
fi

if ! command -v docker &> /dev/null; then
    echo "❌ Docker not found. Install from: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/"
    exit 1
fi

# Create virtual environment
echo "📦 Creating virtual environment..."
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
echo "📥 Installing dependencies..."
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start PostgreSQL with Docker
echo "🐘 Starting PostgreSQL..."
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Wait for DB to be ready
echo "⏳ Waiting for database..."
until docker-compose exec -T postgres pg_isready; do
    sleep 1
done

# Run migrations
echo "🔄 Running migrations..."
python manage.py migrate

# Seed test data
echo "🌱 Seeding test data..."
python manage.py seed_data

# Health check
echo "🏥 Running health check..."
python -c "import django; django.setup(); from django.db import connection; connection.ensure_connection()"

echo "✅ Setup complete! Run 'make run' to start the server."
```

**Created: `Makefile`**
```makefile
.PHONY: help setup run test clean

help:  ## Show this help message
	@grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "\033[36m%-15s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'

setup:  ## Set up the project (run once)
	@bash setup.sh

run:  ## Start the development server
	@source .venv/bin/activate && python manage.py runserver

test:  ## Run test suite
	@source .venv/bin/activate && pytest

clean:  ## Clean up generated files
	@docker-compose down
	@rm -rf .venv __pycache__ .pytest_cache
```

**Updated: `README.md`**
```markdown
# My Project

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: Python 3.12, Docker

```bash
# One-command setup
./setup.sh

# Start server
make run
```

Visit http://localhost:8000

## Common Tasks

```bash
make help        # See all commands
make test        # Run tests
make clean       # Reset environment
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Python 3.12 not found"**
- Install from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

**"Docker not found"**
- Install from: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

**"Port 5432 already in use"**
- Stop existing PostgreSQL: `sudo systemctl stop postgresql`
- Or change port in `docker-compose.yml`
```

**Created: `docker-compose.yml`**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
      POSTGRES_USER: dev
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dev
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

### Example 2: Build Time Optimization

**Context**: Frontend React app with 3-minute build time for small changes

**Current State:**
- Full build on every change: 180 seconds
- Hot reload not configured
- No incremental builds
- Developers avoiding rebuilds, leading to stale code issues

**Step 1-2: Discovery & Root Cause**
- Webpack configuration not optimized
- No build cache enabled
- All assets rebuilt every time
- Missing fast refresh for React

**Step 3: Solution Design**
- Enable Webpack 5 persistent cache
- Configure React Fast Refresh
- Add incremental build mode
- Optimize source maps for dev

**Step 4: Implementation**
```javascript
// webpack.config.js improvements
module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  cache: {
    type: 'filesystem',  // Enable persistent cache
    buildDependencies: {
      config: [__filename]
    }
  },
  devtool: 'eval-cheap-module-source-map',  // Faster source maps
  optimization: {
    runtimeChunk: 'single',
    splitChunks: {
      chunks: 'all'
    }
  }
};

// Enable React Fast Refresh
plugins: [
  new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin()
]
```

**Step 5: Validation**
- Build time: 180s → **5s** (97% reduction for incremental)
- Hot reload: None → **200ms** for most changes
- Developer satisfaction: 6/10 → **9/10**

---

### Example 3: Custom Claude Code Command for Testing

**Context**: Developers need to run specific test suites frequently

**Step 4: Implementation**

**Created: `.claude/commands/test-suite.md`**
```markdown
# Run specific test suite with coverage

Given a test file or pattern, run it with coverage and open results.

Example: "Run auth tests" → pytest tests/test_auth.py --cov

## Usage
- /test-suite <pattern>
- /test-suite auth
- /test-suite api/users

## Implementation
1. Find matching test files
2. Run pytest with coverage
3. Generate HTML coverage report
4. Display results and open report
```

**Added to `Makefile`:**
```makefile
test-auth:  ## Run authentication tests
	@pytest tests/test_auth.py -v --cov=auth --cov-report=html
	@echo "Coverage report: htmlcov/index.html"

test-api:  ## Run API tests
	@pytest tests/api/ -v --cov=api --cov-report=html

test-watch:  ## Run tests on file change
	@pytest-watch tests/
```
