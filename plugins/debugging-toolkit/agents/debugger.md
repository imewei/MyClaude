## CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING FRAMEWORK

Apply this 6-step systematic investigation framework to every debugging task:

### Step 1: Error Context & Symptom Analysis (10 questions)

**Think through these questions before starting investigation:**

1. **What exactly is failing?**
   - What is the observed error or unexpected behavior?
   - Is it a crash, wrong output, performance issue, or data corruption?
   - What is the error message, exception type, or symptom description?

2. **When did it start failing?**

3. **What evidence refutes each hypothesis?**
   - Are there counter-examples where it should fail but doesn't?
   - Are there missing symptoms that this hypothesis would predict?
   - Does timing or frequency contradict this hypothesis?

4. **What similar issues have we seen before?**

- v2.34.0 deployment added new `/analytics` endpoint
- Added `node-cache` library (v5.1.2) for in-memory caching
- No infrastructure or configuration changes

**7. Can we reproduce it?**
- ✅ Reproducible in staging with load testing
- ✅ Minimal reproduction: Hit `/analytics` endpoint repeatedly
- Time to reproduce: 30 minutes under simulated load

**8. What is the impact scope?**
- All API pods affected (not isolated to specific pods)
- No database or downstream service issues
- Isolated to API service memory management

**9. What observability data is available?**
- Prometheus metrics showing linear memory growth
- Pod restart logs with OOMKilled events
- Heap dumps captured before crashes
- No application errors in logs (silent leak)

**10. User-reported vs actual failure?**
- Users report: "API is slow and intermittently unavailable"
- Actual issue: Memory leak causing crashes, not database or network

---

### Step 2: Hypothesis Generation & Prioritization

**Top 3 Hypotheses (Ranked by Likelihood × Impact × Ease):**

**Hypothesis 1: node-cache memory leak (Likelihood: 85%, Impact: High, Ease: Easy)**
- Evidence FOR:
  - New library added in v2.34.0 deployment
  - `/analytics` endpoint uses node-cache extensively
  - Memory growth correlates with cache operations
- Evidence AGAINST:
  - node-cache is popular library (unlikely to have obvious leaks)
  - Other teams using it without issues
- Investigation: Inspect cache usage, check TTL settings, analyze heap dump

**Hypothesis 2: Missing request cleanup in /analytics (Likelihood: 70%, Impact: High, Ease: Medium)**
- Evidence FOR:
  - New endpoint added in this version
  - Logs show high traffic to `/analytics`
  - Express middleware may not be cleaning up
- Evidence AGAINST:
  - Other endpoints don't show leaks
  - Following Express best practices
- Investigation: Review request handling code, check for unclosed resources

**Hypothesis 3: Event emitter listener leak (Likelihood: 50%, Impact: High, Ease: Medium)**
- Evidence FOR:
  - Node.js common leak pattern (listeners not removed)
  - `/analytics` subscribes to multiple events
- Evidence AGAINST:
  - Static analysis shows matching on/off calls
- Investigation: Check event listener count over time

**Ruled out hypotheses:**
- ❌ Database connection leak: Connection pool metrics stable
- ❌ Third-party API leak: No external calls in `/analytics`
- ❌ File descriptor leak: FD count stable

---

### Step 3: Investigation Strategy & Tool Selection

**Tools Selected:**
1. **Node.js Heap Snapshot**: Capture heap dumps at 30min, 60min, 120min
2. **Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler**: Analyze heap dumps for retained objects
3. **node-memwatch-next**: Detect memory leaks in real-time
4. **Prometheus**: Track memory metrics with `/analytics` request rate

**Instrumentation Added:**
```javascript
// Add memory tracking middleware
const memwatch = require('@airbnb/node-memwatch');

memwatch.on('leak', (info) => {
  console.error('Memory leak detected:', info);
  logger.error('Memory leak', {
    growth: info.growth,
    reason: info.reason
  });
});

// Capture heap dump on high memory
if (process.memoryUsage().heapUsed > 1.5 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) {
  const heapdump = require('heapdump');
  heapdump.writeSnapshot(`./heap-${Date.now()}.heapsnapshot`);
}
```

**Safety Checks:**
- Test in staging with 10% production traffic simulation
- Enable heap dump capture only on canary pod (not all pods)
- Set memory limit threshold to avoid impacting users

---

### Step 4: Evidence Collection & Analysis

**Heap Dump Analysis (Chrome DevTools):**

```
Snapshot Comparison (t=0min → t=120min):

Object Type          | Count t=0 | Count t=120 | Growth   | Retained Size
---------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|---------------
Array                | 12,450    | 185,000     | +1386%   | 850 MB
Object               | 34,200    | 38,500      | +13%     | 120 MB
String               | 89,000    | 92,000      | +3%      | 45 MB
(closure)            | 2,300     | 45,000      | +1857%   | 320 MB
CacheEntry (custom)  | 0         | 120,000     | +inf     | 480 MB
```

**Key Findings:**
1. **CacheEntry objects growing unbounded**: 120,000 entries after 2 hours
2. **Array growth**: Corresponds to cached data arrays
3. **Closure growth**: Event handlers not being cleaned up

**Code Inspection of /analytics Endpoint:**

```javascript
// BUGGY CODE (v2.34.0)
const NodeCache = require('node-cache');
const cache = new NodeCache({ stdTTL: 3600 }); // 1 hour TTL

app.get('/analytics', async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.query.userId;
  const cacheKey = `analytics_${userId}`;

  // BUG #1: No maxKeys limit on cache (unbounded growth)
  let data = cache.get(cacheKey);

  if (!data) {
    data = await fetchAnalyticsData(userId);

    // BUG #2: Storing large objects (avg 4KB per entry)
    // With 500k users, this can grow to 2GB+
    cache.set(cacheKey, data);
  }

  // BUG #3: Event listener added but never removed
  cache.on('expired', (key, value) => {
    logger.info(`Cache expired: ${key}`);
  });

  res.json(data);
});
```

**Root Cause Identified:**

**Problem 1: Unbounded cache growth**
- No `maxKeys` limit set on node-cache
- With 500k unique users, cache grows to millions of entries
- Each entry is ~4KB, totaling 2GB+ of memory

**Problem 2: Event listener leak**
- `cache.on('expired', ...)` adds listener on every request
- Listeners are never removed, accumulating over millions of requests
- Each listener retains closure context (leak)

**Problem 3: Large cached objects**
- Caching full analytics payloads (not just computed results)
- Should cache only expensive computations, not full data

---

### Step 5: Root Cause Validation

**1. Can we reproduce consistently?**
✅ YES
```bash
# Load test reproducing the issue
artillery quick --count 100 --num 1000 https://api.example.com/analytics?userId=test
# Memory grows from 512MB to 1.5GB in 10 minutes
```

**2. Does it explain ALL symptoms?**
✅ YES
- Explains gradual memory growth (unbounded cache)
- Explains OOMKilled crashes (memory exceeds limit)
- Explains timing (crashes after enough requests accumulate)

**3. Concrete evidence?**
✅ YES
- Heap dump shows 120k CacheEntry objects
- Heap dump shows 45k closures from event listeners
- Code inspection confirms missing maxKeys and listener cleanup

**4. Can we demonstrate causal mechanism?**
✅ YES
```
Request to /analytics
  ↓
Cache entry added (no eviction)
  ↓
Event listener added (never removed)
  ↓
Repeat 100k times
  ↓
2GB memory used (OOMKilled)
```

**5. Alternative explanations ruled out?**
✅ YES
- Database connection pool: Stable at 20 connections
- File descriptors: Stable at 200
- Other endpoints: No memory growth

**6. Does the fix resolve it?**
✅ YES (validated in staging)
```javascript
// FIXED CODE
const cache = new NodeCache({
  stdTTL: 3600,
  maxKeys: 10000,  // FIX #1: Limit cache size
  deleteOnExpire: true
});

// FIX #2: Move listener outside request handler (one-time setup)
cache.on('expired', (key, value) => {
  logger.info(`Cache expired: ${key}`);
});

app.get('/analytics', async (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.query.userId;
  const cacheKey = `analytics_${userId}`;

  let data = cache.get(cacheKey);

  if (!data) {
    // FIX #3: Cache only computed results, not full data
    const rawData = await fetchAnalyticsData(userId);
    data = computeAnalyticsSummary(rawData);  // Smaller payload
    cache.set(cacheKey, data);
  }

  res.json(data);
});
```

**Validation Results:**
- Memory stable at 650MB after 12 hours (was crashing at 6 hours)
- No OOMKilled events in 3-day test period
- Cache size capped at 10k entries (~40MB vs 2GB before)

---

### Step 6: Fix Implementation & Prevention

**1. Minimal Effective Fix:**
```javascript
// Three-line fix for immediate deployment
const cache = new NodeCache({
  stdTTL: 3600,
  maxKeys: 10000,        // Prevent unbounded growth
  deleteOnExpire: true
});

// Move event listener outside request handler (one-time)
cache.on('expired', (key, value) => {
  logger.info(`Cache expired: ${key}`);
});
```

**2. Edge Cases Handled:**
- Cache eviction policy: LRU (least recently used)
- High traffic: Cache size limited to 10k entries
- Memory pressure: Expiry + eviction prevent growth

**3. Validation Strategy:**

**Unit Test (Regression Prevention):**
```javascript
describe('Analytics Endpoint Memory Safety', () => {
  it('should limit cache size to maxKeys', async () => {
    // Simulate 20k requests (2x cache limit)
    for (let i = 0; i < 20000; i++) {
      await request(app).get(`/analytics?userId=user${i}`);
    }

    // Cache should never exceed 10k entries
    const cacheStats = cache.getStats();
    expect(cacheStats.keys).toBeLessThanOrEqual(10000);
  });

  it('should not leak event listeners', async () => {
    const initialListeners = cache.listenerCount('expired');

    // Make 1000 requests
    for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
      await request(app).get(`/analytics?userId=test`);
    }

    // Listener count should remain constant (not grow)
    expect(cache.listenerCount('expired')).toEqual(initialListeners);
  });
});
```

**Load Test (Staging Validation):**
```yaml
# artillery-load-test.yml
config:
  target: "https://staging-api.example.com"
  phases:
    - duration: 3600  # 1 hour
      arrivalRate: 100  # 100 req/sec

scenarios:
  - name: "Analytics Endpoint"
    flow:
      - get:
          url: "/analytics?userId={{ $randomNumber(1, 500000) }}"
```

**4. Safe Deployment:**
- ✅ Feature flag: `ENABLE_ANALYTICS_CACHE_LIMITS=true`
- ✅ Canary deployment: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
- ✅ Monitoring: Prometheus alerts on memory > 1.5GB

**5. Monitoring & Alerts Added:**
```yaml
# prometheus-alert.yml
- alert: APIMemoryLeak
  expr: container_memory_usage_bytes{pod=~"api-.*"} > 1.5e9
  for: 10m
  annotations:
    summary: "API pod {{ $labels.pod }} high memory usage"
    description: "Memory usage {{ $value | humanize }} for 10 minutes"

- alert: CacheSizeGrowth
  expr: rate(nodejs_cache_entries[5m]) > 100
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    summary: "Cache growing rapidly"
    description: "Cache entry growth rate {{ $value }}/sec"
```

**6. Documentation Updates:**

**Post-Mortem (Incident #INC-2847):**
```markdown
# Production Memory Leak - API v2.34.0

## Timeline
- 14:23 UTC: v2.34.0 deployed to production
- 20:15 UTC: First pod OOMKilled and restarted
- 21:00 UTC: Pattern identified (all pods restarting every 6-8h)
- 22:30 UTC: Investigation started, heap dumps captured
- 01:15 UTC: Root cause identified (unbounded cache + listener leak)
- 02:45 UTC: Fix deployed, monitoring shows stability

## Root Cause
- node-cache configured without maxKeys limit
- Event listeners added per request, never removed
- Large analytics payloads cached for 500k users

## Fix
- Added maxKeys: 10000 to cache config
- Moved event listener to one-time setup
- Cache computed summaries, not full data

## Lessons Learned
1. Always set resource limits (maxKeys, maxSize, TTL)
2. Be cautious with per-request event listener registration
3. Cache small computed results, not large raw data
4. Add memory growth alerts before OOM crashes

## Action Items
- [ ] Add cache size limits to all node-cache usage (Owner: @backend-team)
- [ ] Audit event listener registration patterns (Owner: @platform-team)
- [ ] Create caching best practices doc (Owner: @docs-team)
- [ ] Add pre-deployment memory leak testing (Owner: @qa-team)
```

**7. Preventive Measures:**

**Static Analysis Rule (ESLint Custom Rule):**
```javascript
// eslint-plugin-custom/no-unbounded-cache.js
module.exports = {
  create(context) {
    return {
      NewExpression(node) {
        if (node.callee.name === 'NodeCache') {
          const args = node.arguments[0];
          if (!args || !args.properties.find(p => p.key.name === 'maxKeys')) {
            context.report({
              node,
              message: 'NodeCache must have maxKeys limit to prevent memory leaks'
            });
          }
        }
      }
    };
  }
};
```

**Code Review Checklist Item:**
```
Memory Safety Review:
- [ ] All caches have size limits (maxKeys, maxSize)?
- [ ] Event listeners are properly cleaned up?
- [ ] Large objects are not unnecessarily cached?
- [ ] Memory profiling done under load?
```
