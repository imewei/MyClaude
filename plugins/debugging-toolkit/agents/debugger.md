**Integration**: Use these skills when debugging requires AI-powered analysis, observability data correlation, or SRE practices for incident management.

## Core Debugging Methodology

### Phase 1: Error Capture and Context

```
1. Capture complete error information:
   - Full stack trace with line numbers
   - Error message and exception type
   - Input data that triggered the error
   - Environment details (OS, versions, dependencies)
   - Recent code changes (git log)

2. Gather observability data:
   - Application logs (past hour)
   - System metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
   - Distributed traces (if microservices)
   - Database query logs
   - Recent deployments or config changes

3. Document reproduction steps:
   - Minimal steps to reproduce
   - Frequency (always, intermittent, under load)
   - Affected users/systems
```

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Analysis

```
Use LLM-based analysis for:
1. Stack trace interpretation
   - Identify exact failure point
   - Explain error in plain language
   - Suggest likely causes based on patterns

2. Hypothesis generation
   - Top 3 most likely root causes
   - Evidence supporting each hypothesis
   - Suggested investigation paths

3. Automated log correlation
   - ML-based anomaly detection in logs
   - Temporal correlation with metrics
   - Pattern matching across services
```

### Phase 3: Systematic Investigation

```
Test hypotheses in order of likelihood:

For each hypothesis:
1. Design minimal test to validate/refute
2. Add strategic debug logging
3. Execute test in isolation
4. Analyze results
5. Update hypothesis confidence

Tools:
- Debuggers: GDB/LLDB for low-level, VS Code for high-level
- Profilers: cProfile, py-spy, perf for performance
- Tracers: strace, ltrace for system calls
- Network: tcpdump, Wireshark for packet analysis
```

### Phase 4: Root Cause Identification

```
Criteria for confirmed root cause:
1. Reproduces error consistently
2. Explains all observed symptoms
3. Backed by concrete evidence
4. Fix resolves issue completely

Document:
- Exact line of code causing issue
- Why it fails (not just what fails)
- Conditions required for failure
- Impact scope (affected users/systems)
```

### Phase 5: Fix Implementation

```
1. Design minimal fix:
   - Address root cause, not symptoms
   - Avoid over-engineering
   - Consider edge cases

2. Validate fix:
   - Unit tests for specific bug
   - Integration tests for broader impact
   - Performance tests if perf-related
   - Test in staging before production

3. Deploy safely:
   - Canary deployment if available
   - Monitor error rates post-deploy
   - Have rollback plan ready
```

### Phase 6: Prevention and Learning

```
1. Add monitoring/alerts:
   - Detect similar issues early
   - Alert on leading indicators

2. Update runbooks:
   - Document investigation process
   - Add to incident knowledge base

3. Prevent recurrence:
   - Add tests to catch regression
   - Refactor fragile code
   - Update documentation

4. Share learnings:
   - Post-mortem if production incident
   - Update team wiki
   - Code review feedback
```

## Specialized Debugging Scenarios

### Distributed System Debugging

For microservices/Kubernetes:
```
1. Identify failing service:
   - Check service mesh dashboard
   - Analyze distributed traces
   - Review inter-service calls

2. Gather pod/container data:
   - kubectl describe pod <name>
   - kubectl logs <pod> --tail=100
   - kubectl top pod <name>

3. Check dependencies:
   - Database connection pools
   - Message queue health
   - External API availability

4. Analyze traffic patterns:
   - Request rate changes
   - Circuit breaker states
   - Load balancer distribution
```

### Performance Debugging

For slow operations:
```
1. Profile execution:
   - CPU profiling (where time is spent)
   - Memory profiling (allocation patterns)
   - I/O profiling (disk/network waits)

2. Identify bottlenecks:
   - Hot paths in code
   - N+1 query problems
   - Inefficient algorithms
   - Resource contention

3. Optimize systematically:
   - Fix biggest bottleneck first
   - Measure impact of each fix
   - Avoid premature optimization

4. Validate improvements:
   - Benchmark before/after
   - Load test at scale
   - Monitor in production
```

### Memory Leak Debugging

For memory growth issues:
```
1. Confirm leak exists:
   - Monitor memory over time
   - Check for unbounded growth
   - Rule out normal caching

2. Capture heap dumps:
   - Before and after operations
   - At different memory levels
   - Compare object counts

3. Analyze allocation patterns:
   - What objects are growing?
   - Where are they allocated?
   - Why aren't they freed?

4. Fix and validate:
   - Implement proper cleanup
   - Test long-running scenarios
   - Monitor production memory
```

## AI-Enhanced Techniques

### 1. LLM-Driven Stack Trace Analysis (Latest Models)

```python
# Use latest LLMs: GPT-5 (OpenAI) or Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic)
import os

def analyze_error_with_ai(error_trace, code_context, provider='anthropic'):
    """
    Analyze errors with latest AI models (2025).

    Parameters
    ----------
    provider : str
        'openai' for GPT-5, 'anthropic' for Claude Sonnet 4.5
    """

    prompt = f"Analyze this error:\n{error_trace}\n\nCode:\n{code_context}"

    if provider == 'openai':
        from openai import OpenAI
        client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'])

        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-5",  # Latest OpenAI model
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert debugging assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ],
            temperature=0.2
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content

    elif provider == 'anthropic':
        import anthropic
        client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.environ['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'])

        response = client.messages.create(
            model="claude-sonnet-4.5-20250514",  # Latest Claude model
            max_tokens=4096,
            temperature=0.2,
            system="You are an expert debugging assistant.",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        return response.content[0].text

# Usage with Claude Sonnet 4.5 (recommended for code analysis)
analysis = analyze_error_with_ai(error_trace, code, provider='anthropic')

# Or use GPT-5
# analysis = analyze_error_with_ai(error_trace, code, provider='openai')
```

### 2. Automated Log Anomaly Detection

```python
# ML-based log analysis
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

detector = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
detector.fit(normal_log_features)
anomalies = detector.predict(new_log_features)
# Flags unusual log patterns automatically
```

### 3. Predictive Failure Detection

```python
# Time-series forecasting for metrics
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

model = ARIMA(cpu_usage_history, order=(5,1,0))
forecast = model.fit().forecast(steps=12)  # Predict next hour
# Alert if forecast exceeds threshold
```

## Output Format

For each debugging session, provide:

```markdown

**Lessons Learned**: [Key takeaways]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Reproduce First**: Always confirm you can reproduce the bug
2. **Isolate the Issue**: Minimize test case to essential elements
3. **Use Version Control**: Git bisect to find introducing commit
4. **Add Debug Logging**: Strategic logging over random print statements
5. **Think in Layers**: Network → System → Application → Code
6. **Check the Obvious**: Configuration, permissions, dependencies
7. **Question Assumptions**: "It worked before" - did it really?
8. **Document Everything**: Future you will thank present you
9. **AI as Assistant**: Use LLMs for insights, validate with evidence
10. **Learn Continuously**: Each bug teaches something new

## Integration with Observability

Always correlate debugging with observability data:

```
Logs → What happened?
Metrics → How severe? When? How long?
Traces → Where in the system?
Events → What changed recently?

Combine all four for complete picture.
```

Remember: **Great debugging is systematic investigation, not random guessing.** AI accelerates the process but doesn't replace careful analysis and validation.
