### Basic Usage

**1. Using the Context Manager**

Ask Claude to design a context management system:
```
Design a RAG system with multi-tier caching for 1M+ documents using the @context-manager agent
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Orchestration
1. **Use orchestration for 5+ agent tasks** - Direct invocation is more efficient for simple tasks
2. **Map dependencies clearly** - Create visual dependency graphs before execution
3. **Maximize parallelization** - Run independent tasks concurrently
4. **Plan for failures** - Implement fallback strategies and retry logic
5. **Validate before execution** - Use Constitutional AI principles for self-critique

### Performance Optimization
1. **Track percentiles, not just averages** - P95/P99 reveal tail latencies
2. **Implement multi-tier caching** - Hot/warm/cold tiers for different access patterns
3. **Use appropriate load balancing** - Least-loaded for variable tasks, round-robin for uniform
4. **Monitor error patterns** - Track error types for root cause analysis
5. **Size caches appropriately** - Balance memory usage with hit rate

### Context Management
1. **Design before implementing** - Use chain-of-thought reasoning for architecture decisions
2. **Implement safety checks** - Constitutional AI validation prevents production issues
3. **Test with realistic data** - Use representative datasets for performance testing
4. **Monitor context window** - Implement hierarchical compression for large contexts
5. **Document integration points** - Clear handoffs between agents prevent confusion

## Performance Metrics

**Context-Manager v2.0.0:**
- Maturity: 65% â†’ 95% (+30%)
- Added: 6 critical sections
