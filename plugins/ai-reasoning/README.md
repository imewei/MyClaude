**1. Using Ultra-Think for Complex Problem-Solving**

Solve a complex debugging problem:
```
/ultra-think "Memory leak in production causing OOM after 6 hours" --framework=root-cause-analysis --depth=deep
```

The command will:
- Apply Root Cause Analysis framework systematically
- Generate 20-40 structured thoughts with hierarchical tracking
- Explore multiple hypotheses through branching (H1, H2, H3)
- Detect and resolve any logical contradictions
- Validate findings through multi-agent coordination (Planner, Researcher, Analyst, Critic)

- Save session for future resumption

**Example Output Structure:**
```markdown
### T1.1 - Planning: Problem Framing
**Reasoning**: OOM after 6 hours suggests slow accumulation...
**Confidence**: High (0.90)

### T1.2 - Analysis: Gather Evidence
**Evidence**:
- Memory graphs show linear growth
- Growth independent of request load
**Confidence**: High (0.95)

### T3.1 - Analysis: Hypothesis Generation
