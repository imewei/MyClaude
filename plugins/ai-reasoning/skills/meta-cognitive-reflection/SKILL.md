## Overview

Analyze and reflect on AI reasoning patterns, cognitive processes, and conversation quality to improve decision-making effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. This skill provides frameworks for systematic meta-cognitive analysis including reasoning pattern identification, bias detection, problem-solving evaluation, and communication effectiveness assessment.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Reasoning Pattern Analysis

Identify and evaluate different types of reasoning used in AI responses:

**Reasoning Types:**
- **Deductive Reasoning**: Drawing specific conclusions from general principles
- **Inductive Reasoning**: Drawing general conclusions from specific observations
- **Abductive Reasoning**: Inferring best explanations for observations
- **Analogical Reasoning**: Drawing parallels from similar domains
- **Causal Reasoning**: Identifying cause-effect relationships

For detailed pattern taxonomy and examples, read `references/reasoning_patterns_taxonomy.md`.

**Analysis Process:**
1. Review conversation history or specific responses
2. Identify instances of each reasoning type
3. Evaluate effectiveness and appropriateness
4. Assess logical validity and evidence strength
5. Generate insights and recommendations

### 2. Cognitive Bias Detection

Identify and mitigate cognitive biases in AI reasoning:

**Common Biases:**
- **Availability Bias**: Over-relying on recent or readily available examples
- **Anchoring Bias**: Over-relying on first information encountered
- **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking evidence that supports initial hypotheses
- **Recency Bias**: Overweighting recent information
- **Selection Bias**: Non-representative sampling or example selection

For complete bias checklist and mitigation strategies, read `references/cognitive_biases_checklist.md`.

**Detection Process:**
1. Review decision-making patterns
2. Check for bias indicators
3. Assess severity and impact
4. Recommend mitigation strategies
5. Document for learning

### 3. Problem-Solving Evaluation

Assess problem-solving approach and effectiveness:

**Evaluation Stages:**
1. **Problem Understanding**
   - Clarity of problem definition
   - Requirement coverage
   - Assumption identification

2. **Strategy Formulation**
   - Approaches considered
   - Selection rationale
   - Anticipated challenges

3. **Implementation**
   - Execution quality
   - Error handling
   - Efficiency

4. **Validation**
   - Testing thoroughness
   - Edge case coverage
   - Verification methods

5. **Iteration**
   - Adaptation to feedback
   - Refinement effectiveness
   - Learning incorporation

### 4. Communication Effectiveness

Evaluate communication quality and clarity:

**Assessment Dimensions:**
- **Clarity**: Appropriate jargon level, explanation depth, structure
- **Accuracy**: Factual correctness, technical precision, citation quality
- **Pedagogy**: Example quality, progressive disclosure, concept scaffolding
- **Relevance**: On-topic focus, priority alignment, tangent handling
- **Engagement**: Interactivity, encouragement, collaboration

### 5. Session Reflection Report

Generate comprehensive reflection reports using the template:

```bash
# Use the report template
cp assets/session_reflection_template.md ./session_reflection_YYYYMMDD.md
```

**Report Sections:**
- Executive Summary: Overall assessment and key findings
- Reasoning Analysis: Pattern identification and effectiveness
- Cognitive Biases: Detected biases and mitigation

- Communication: Effectiveness assessment
- Meta-Reflection: Reflection on reflection quality
- Recommendations: Actionable improvements

## Workflow: Conducting Meta-Cognitive Reflection

### Step 1: Define Reflection Scope

### Step 5: Evaluate Problem-Solving

Assess each stage of problem-solving:
