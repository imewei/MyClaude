# Meta-Cognitive Reflection

Systematic analysis of AI reasoning, decision-making, and interaction quality.

---

## Reasoning Types

| Type | Description | Detection |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Deductive | General → specific | "If A then B" patterns |
| Inductive | Specific → general | Pattern recognition |
| Abductive | Best explanation | Inference to cause |
| Analogical | Cross-domain mapping | "Similar to X" patterns |
| Causal | Cause-effect | "Because" relationships |

---

## Cognitive Biases

| Bias | Detection | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Availability | Over-relying on recent examples | Seek diverse examples |
| Anchoring | First info dominates | Consider alternatives |
| Confirmation | Seeking supporting evidence | Test contradictions |
| Recency | Overweighting recent | Review full context |
| Selection | Non-representative sampling | Systematic coverage |

---

## Problem-Solving Evaluation

| Stage | Questions |
|-------|-----------|
| Understanding | Clear problem definition? Requirements covered? |
| Strategy | Approaches considered? Rationale documented? |
| Implementation | Quality execution? Errors handled? |
| Validation | Testing thorough? Edge cases covered? |
| Iteration | Adapted to feedback? Learned? |

---

## Communication Assessment

| Dimension | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| Clarity | Appropriate jargon, structure, depth |
| Accuracy | Factual correctness, precision |
| Pedagogy | Example quality, scaffolding |
| Relevance | On-topic, priority alignment |
| Engagement | Interactivity, collaboration |

## Reflection Workflow

1. **Define Scope** - Single conversation, decision, or session
2. **Gather Context** - Conversation history, outcomes, feedback
3. **Analyze Reasoning** - Identify types, count instances, evaluate
4. **Detect Biases** - Check indicators, assess severity
5. **Evaluate Problem-Solving** - Score each stage
6. **Assess Communication** - Rate dimensions
7. **Generate Insights** - Patterns, strengths, weaknesses
8. **Create Report** - Summary, recommendations, actions

## Best Practices

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Be Objective | Base on evidence, not assumptions |
| Quantify | Use metrics and counts |
| Context Matters | Consider task complexity |
| Balance | Acknowledge strengths and weaknesses |
| Actionable | Provide specific improvements |
| Meta-Reflect | Assess reflection quality itself |
