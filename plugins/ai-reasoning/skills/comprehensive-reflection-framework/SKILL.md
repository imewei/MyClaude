# Comprehensive Reflection Framework

Multi-dimensional analysis integrating cognitive, technical, research, and strategic perspectives.

---

## Reflection Dimensions

| Dimension | Focus | Key Questions |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Meta-Cognitive | Reasoning, biases, communication | Were decisions well-reasoned? |
| Research Quality | Methodology, experimental design | Is the science rigorous? |
| Technical Quality | Code, architecture, testing | Is technical debt controlled? |
| Strategic | Goals, resources, priorities | Are we on trajectory? |

---

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

```bash
# Session context
git log --oneline -10
git branch --show-current

# Project metrics
find . -name "*.py" | wc -l
find . -name "*test*" | wc -l
```

**Collect**: Conversation history, research materials, codebase state, goal documents

### Phase 2: Parallel Analysis

| Dimension | Skill | Output |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Meta-Cognitive | meta-cognitive-reflection | Reasoning report |
| Research | research-quality-assessment | Quality report |
| Technical | Code analysis tools | Technical report |
| Strategic | Goal tracking | Progress report |

### Phase 3: Pattern Synthesis

| Pattern Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Reinforcing | Strength in one area enables another |
| Conflicting | Tradeoffs between dimensions |
| Gap | Strength-weakness misalignment |
| Opportunity | Cross-dimensional synergies |

**Examples**:
- "Strong reasoning but weak documentation" → Integration opportunity
- "High code quality but slow progress" → Speed vs quality tradeoff

### Phase 4: Meta-Level Insights

**Assess**:
- **System Health**: Trajectory (improving/stable/declining)
- **Effectiveness**: Input-output efficiency, learning rate
- **Sustainability**: Technical debt, cognitive load, resource use

### Phase 5: Strategic Recommendations

| Timeframe | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| Immediate (week) | Critical fixes, quick wins |
| Short-term (month) | Important improvements |
| Medium-term (quarter) | Structural changes |
| Long-term (year) | Transformative goals |

---

## Depth Modes

| Mode | Duration | Scope |
|------|----------|-------|
| Quick | 15 min | 1-2 dimensions, top issues |
| Deep | 1-2 hours | All dimensions, full synthesis |
| Ultra-Deep | 4+ hours | Exhaustive, scenario planning |

---

## Scoring Framework

### Overall Health Score: X.X/10

| Dimension | Weight | Score | Trend |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Meta-Cognitive | 25% | X.X/10 | ↑/→/↓ |
| Research Quality | 25% | X.X/10 | ↑/→/↓ |
| Technical Quality | 25% | X.X/10 | ↑/→/↓ |
| Strategic | 25% | X.X/10 | ↑/→/↓ |

### Interpretation

| Score | Level | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 9-10 | Excellent | Maintain, optimize |
| 7-8 | Very Good | Minor improvements |
| 5-6 | Good | Targeted work |
| 3-4 | Fair | Significant work needed |
| 1-2 | Poor | Major intervention |

## Integration Patterns

### Reasoning → Code Quality
- Strong deductive reasoning correlates with structured code
- Apply systematic reasoning to architecture decisions

### Research Rigor → Technical Debt
- Research thoroughness inversely related to debt
- Adopt reproducibility practices in development

### Communication → Collaboration
- Clear communication enables effective teamwork
- Apply insights to documentation

---

## Example Applications

**Quarterly Review**:
1. Gather commits, conversations, research outputs
2. Run all four dimensional analyses
3. Synthesize cross-cutting patterns
4. Generate integrated report with recommendations

**Pre-Grant Proposal**:
1. Assess research quality (methodology, feasibility)
2. Evaluate reasoning and communication (writing)
3. Check technical readiness (implementation plan)
4. Strategic analysis (alignment, impact)
5. Identify strengthening opportunities

---

## Report Structure

1. **Executive Summary**: Overall assessment, key findings
2. **Dimensional Analysis**: Findings from each dimension
3. **Cross-Cutting Patterns**: Synthesis and connections
4. **Meta-Level Insights**: System-level understanding
5. **Strategic Recommendations**: Prioritized actions
6. **Meta-Reflection**: Quality of reflection process

---

## Best Practices

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Regular schedule | Weekly (quick), monthly (deep), quarterly (ultra) |
| Continuous data | Don't rely only on memory |
| Honest assessment | Quality depends on objectivity |
| Actionable insights | Every insight leads to action |
| Track patterns | Maintain reflection history |
| Balance dimensions | Don't over-optimize one area |

---

## Continuous Improvement Cycle

```
Reflect → Insights → Actions → Execute → Reflect
```

- Reflection without action is wasted
- Action without reflection is blind
- Close the loop
