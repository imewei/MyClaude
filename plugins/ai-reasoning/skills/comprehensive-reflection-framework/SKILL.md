description: Orchestrate multi-dimensional reflection across cognitive, technical, scientific, and strategic dimensions to generate integrated insights and cross-cutting patterns. This skill should be used when conducting holistic project reviews that span multiple dimensions (reasoning quality, code quality, research methodology, strategic alignment), when performing multi-dimensional quality assessments before major milestones, when evaluating comprehensive project health across all aspects of work (AI reasoning patterns, technical debt, scientific rigor, goal progress), when preparing quarterly or annual reviews that require integrated analysis, when conducting strategic planning sessions that need cross-functional insights, when preparing grant proposals or funding applications requiring comprehensive project evaluation, when performing post-mortem analysis after major projects or initiatives, when assessing overall system health and trajectory across cognitive/technical/scientific/strategic dimensions, when identifying cross-cutting patterns and opportunities that span multiple work areas, or when deep, integrated, holistic insights are needed to inform major decisions or strategic direction. Use this skill for quarterly reviews, major project milestones, grant proposal preparation, career retrospectives, strategic planning sessions, comprehensive health checks, or any scenario requiring multi-dimensional evaluation and synthesis of cross-cutting insights.

## Overview

Orchestrate multi-dimensional reflection across cognitive, technical, scientific, and strategic dimensions to generate integrated insights and cross-cutting patterns. This framework combines meta-cognitive reflection, research quality assessment, code analysis, and strategic thinking into a unified, holistic evaluation.

## Reflection Dimensions

### 1. Meta-Cognitive Dimension
**Focus**: AI reasoning, cognitive biases, communication effectiveness

**Key Questions**:
- What reasoning patterns were used?
- Were there cognitive biases affecting decisions?
- How effective was problem-solving?
- Was communication clear and appropriate?

**Use**: `meta-cognitive-reflection` skill for this dimension

---

### 2. Research Quality Dimension
**Focus**: Scientific methodology, experimental design, statistical rigor

**Key Questions**:
- Is the methodology sound and reproducible?
- Is the experimental design appropriate and adequately powered?
- Are statistical analyses rigorous and valid?
- Is the work publication-ready?

**Use**: `research-quality-assessment` skill for this dimension

---

### 3. Technical Quality Dimension
**Focus**: Code quality, architecture, testing, technical debt

**Key Questions**:
- Is code quality improving or declining?
- Are testing practices adequate?
- Is technical debt under control?
- Are development workflows efficient?

**Tools**: Code analysis, test coverage, complexity metrics

---

### 4. Strategic Dimension
**Focus**: Goal alignment, progress trajectory, resource allocation

**Key Questions**:
- Are we making progress toward goals?
- Are resources allocated optimally?
- Are priorities correct?
- What strategic opportunities exist?

**Analysis**: Progress tracking, trajectory analysis, opportunity identification

---

## Comprehensive Reflection Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

Collect information across all dimensions:

```bash
# Session context
- Working directory: $(pwd)
- Recent commits: $(git log --oneline -10)
- Active branch: $(git branch --show-current)

# Project metrics
- Total files: $(find . -type f | wc -l)
- Code files: $(find . -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" | wc -l)
- Tests: $(find . -name "*test*" | wc -l)
```

**Gather**:
- Conversation history (for meta-cognitive analysis)
- Research materials (for quality assessment)
- Codebase state (for technical analysis)
- Goal/milestone documents (for strategic analysis)

---

### Phase 2: Parallel Dimensional Analysis

Run reflections in parallel across dimensions:

#### 2A: Meta-Cognitive Analysis
Use `meta-cognitive-reflection` skill:
1. Analyze reasoning patterns
2. Detect cognitive biases
3. Evaluate problem-solving
4. Assess communication

**Output**: Meta-cognitive reflection report

#### 2B: Research Quality Assessment
Use `research-quality-assessment` skill (if applicable):
1. Evaluate methodology
2. Review experimental design
3. Assess data quality
4. Check statistical rigor
5. Evaluate publication readiness

**Output**: Research assessment report

#### 2C: Technical Quality Analysis
Analyze code and development practices:
1. Code quality metrics (complexity, duplication)
2. Test coverage trends
3. Technical debt assessment
4. Development velocity

**Output**: Technical quality report

#### 2D: Strategic Analysis
Evaluate progress and alignment:
1. Goal progress assessment
2. Resource allocation efficiency
3. Priority optimization
4. Opportunity identification

**Output**: Strategic analysis report

---

### Phase 3: Pattern Synthesis

Identify cross-cutting patterns across dimensions:

**Look for**:
- Themes appearing in multiple dimensions
- Strengths to leverage across areas
- Common improvement opportunities
- Hidden connections and insights

**Pattern Types**:
1. **Reinforcing Patterns**: Strengths in one area enabling another
2. **Conflicting Patterns**: Tradeoffs between dimensions
3. **Gap Patterns**: Strength in one area, weakness in another
4. **Opportunity Patterns**: Cross-dimensional synergies

**Example Patterns**:
- "Strong reasoning but weak documentation" → Integration opportunity
- "High code quality but slow progress" → Speed vs quality tradeoff
- "Good research design but insufficient resources" → Resource allocation issue

---

### Phase 4: Meta-Level Insights

Generate insights about the system as a whole:

**System Health**:
- Overall trajectory (improving, stable, declining)
- Balance across dimensions
- Systemic issues or strengths
- Emergent properties

**Effectiveness**:
- Input to output efficiency
- Learning and adaptation rate
- Problem-solving capability
- Innovation potential

**Sustainability**:
- Technical debt trends
- Cognitive load management
- Resource sustainability
- Long-term viability

---

### Phase 5: Strategic Recommendations

Synthesize actionable recommendations:

**Immediate Actions** (This Week):
- Critical fixes
- Quick wins
- Urgent interventions

**Short-term Actions** (This Month):
- Important improvements
- Strategic initiatives
- Capability building

**Medium-term Goals** (This Quarter):

---

### Phase 6: Comprehensive Report Generation

Create integrated reflection report using template:

```bash
cp assets/comprehensive_reflection_template.md ./reflection_YYYYMMDD.md
```

**Report Structure**:
1. Executive Summary (overall assessment, key findings)
2. Dimensional Analysis (findings from each dimension)
3. Cross-Cutting Patterns (synthesis and connections)
4. Meta-Level Insights (system-level understanding)
5. Strategic Recommendations (prioritized actions)
6. Meta-Reflection (reflection on reflection quality)

## Best Practices

1. **Schedule Regular Reflections**: Weekly (quick), monthly (deep), quarterly (ultra-deep)
2. **Collect Data Continuously**: Don't rely only on memory during reflection
3. **Be Honest and Objective**: Reflection quality depends on honest self-assessment
4. **Focus on Actionability**: Every insight should lead to action or understanding
5. **Track Patterns Over Time**: Maintain reflection history to identify trends
6. **Balance Dimensions**: Don't over-optimize one dimension at expense of others
7. **Celebrate Successes**: Acknowledge what's working well, not just problems
8. **Learn and Adapt**: Use reflection insights to improve processes
9. **Share Insights**: Reflection becomes more valuable when shared appropriately
10. **Meta-Reflect**: Periodically reflect on the reflection process itself

---

## Continuous Improvement Cycle

```
Reflect → Insights → Actions → Execute → Reflect
   ↑                                        ↓
   ←────────────────────────────────────────
```

1. **Reflect**: Conduct comprehensive reflection
2. **Insights**: Generate actionable insights
3. **Actions**: Define specific improvements
4. **Execute**: Implement changes
5. **Reflect**: Evaluate effectiveness → Repeat

**Key**: Close the loop - reflection without action is wasted, action without reflection is blind.
