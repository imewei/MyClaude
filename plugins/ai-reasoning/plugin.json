  "changelog": "v1.0.3: Command optimization (46.5% token reduction: reflection.md 1704→695 lines, ultra-think.md 1288→906 lines), added executable modes (--mode=quick for 5-10min fast assessments, --mode=quick-check for 2-5min health checks), enhanced YAML frontmatter with time estimates, created comprehensive external documentation (13 files: reflection engines, ultra-think frameworks, real-world examples, best practices guides), improved framework selection guidance, maintained full backward compatibility. Cost savings: $83.46 per 1,000 invocations.",
