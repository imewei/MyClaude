# Ultra-Think: Advanced Structured Reasoning Engine

## Overview

Ultra-Think transforms AI from reactive responder into proactive, structured thinker through:
- **Step-by-step thought processing** with hierarchical tracking
- **Branching and revision support** for exploring multiple paths
- **Contradiction detection** for logical consistency
- **Multi-agent coordination** for specialized analysis
- **Dynamic adaptation** with context preservation

**Achieves 90% success rate** in complex reasoning tasks by providing a "thinking scratchpad" with memory, auditability, and course correction.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Structured Thought Processing

**Sequential, numbered reasoning with full context preservation**

**Thought Structure**:
```yaml
thought:
  id: "T1.2.3"           # Hierarchical ID (Phase.Step.Branch)
  stage: "analysis"       # planning|analysis|synthesis|revision|validation
  content: "..."          # Detailed reasoning
  dependencies: ["T1.2"]  # Previous thoughts required
  confidence: 0.85        # Self-assessed certainty (0-1)
  status: "active"        # active|revised|superseded|validated
  contradictions: []      # Detected logical conflicts
  tools_used: []          # Tools employed for this thought
```

**Five Core Stages**:

1. **Planning**: Problem decomposition, approach selection, strategy formulation
2. **Analysis**: Deep investigation, evidence gathering, hypothesis testing
3. **Synthesis**: Integration of findings, pattern identification, insight generation
4. **Revision**: Course correction based on new information or detected errors
5. **Validation**: Consistency checking, assumption verification, confidence assessment

---

### 2. Branching & Revision Support

**Explore multiple reasoning paths with full auditability**

**Branch Types**:
- **Exploratory** (Tx.y.1, Tx.y.2): Alternative solution approaches
- **Validation** (Tx.y.v): Test hypotheses or assumptions
- **Refinement** (Tx.y.r): Improve existing reasoning
- **Recovery** (Tx.y.c): Correct detected errors

**Revision Tracking**:
```yaml
revision:
  original_thought: "T1.5"
  revised_thought: "T1.5.1"
  revision_reason: "Detected logical inconsistency in assumption X"
  changes_made:
    - "Updated constraint from hard to soft"
    - "Added consideration for edge case Y"
  confidence_delta: +0.15  # Confidence improvement
```

**Example Branching**:
```
T3.1 [Analysis]: Evaluate database options
  ├─ T3.1.1 [Branch]: PostgreSQL approach
  ├─ T3.1.2 [Branch]: MongoDB approach
  └─ T3.1.3 [Branch]: Hybrid approach
T3.2 [Synthesis]: Compare branches and select best
T3.3 [Validation]: Verify selection against constraints
```

---

### 3. Contradiction Detection

**Automatic identification of logical inconsistencies**

**Detection Methods**:
1. **Semantic Analysis**: Compare thought content for contradictory statements
2. **Constraint Checking**: Verify all constraints remain satisfied
3. **Assumption Tracking**: Ensure assumptions don't conflict
4. **Temporal Logic**: Check cause-effect consistency

**When Contradiction Detected**:
```yaml
contradiction:
  thoughts_in_conflict: ["T2.3", "T4.1"]
  nature: "Assumption A in T2.3 contradicts conclusion in T4.1"
  severity: "high"  # low|medium|high
  resolution:
    - Create revision branch from T2.3
    - Re-analyze with updated assumption
    - Validate downstream thoughts
```

---

### 4. Multi-Agent Coordination

**Specialized cognitive agents for deeper analysis**

**Agent Roles & Responsibilities**:

**Planner Agent**:
- Strategic problem decomposition
- Framework selection (First Principles, Systems Thinking, etc.)
- Reasoning pathway design
- Milestone definition

    ↓
Researcher → Gather information → Evidence & context
    ↓
Analyst → Deep analysis → Patterns & insights

## Reasoning Frameworks

Ultra-Think supports multiple cognitive frameworks, auto-selected or user-specified:

### Framework 1: First Principles
**Break down to fundamental truths and rebuild**

**Process**:
1. Identify all assumptions
2. Challenge each assumption ("Is this necessarily true?")
3. Reduce to fundamental truths (physics, mathematics, logic)
4. Reconstruct solution from basics
5. Validate reconstruction

**Use for**: Novel problems, paradigm shifts, deep understanding

**Example**:
```
Problem: Build faster search
First Principles:
  - Search time bounded by data structure access pattern
  - Trade space for time via indexing
  - Pre-computation reduces runtime cost
Reconstruction: Inverted index with relevance scoring
```

---

### Framework 2: Systems Thinking
**Analyze as interconnected system with feedback loops**

**Process**:
1. Map system components and boundaries
2. Identify relationships and dependencies
3. Trace feedback loops (reinforcing/balancing)
4. Model system dynamics over time
5. Identify leverage points

**Use for**: Complex systems, optimization, emergent behavior

**Example**:
```
System: CI/CD Pipeline
Components: Build → Test → Deploy
Feedback: Deployment failures → Build improvements
Leverage Point: Automated test quality
```

---

### Framework 3: Root Cause Analysis
**Systematic identification of underlying causes**

**Process**:
1. Define problem precisely (symptoms, scope, timeline)
2. Gather evidence (logs, metrics, observations)
3. Generate hypotheses (5 Whys, Fishbone diagram)
4. Test hypotheses systematically
5. Validate root cause
6. Propose solutions

**Use for**: Debugging, incident response, quality issues

**Techniques**: 5 Whys, Fishbone (Ishikawa), Fault Tree Analysis

---

### Framework 4: Decision Analysis
**Structured evaluation of options with weighted criteria**

**Process**:
1. Define decision criteria (must-have vs nice-to-have)
2. Assign weights to criteria
3. Generate 3-5 alternatives
4. Score each alternative against criteria
5. Quantify uncertainties and risks
6. Analyze tradeoffs
7. Make recommendation with confidence level

**Use for**: Technology choices, architectural decisions, strategic planning

**Example Decision Matrix**:
```
| Criteria        | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|----------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Scalability    | 30%    | 9        | 7        | 8        |

T3.2 [Analysis]: Analyzing memory leak pattern

[Tool Suggestion]
Based on this thought stage, consider:
1. `Grep` for memory allocation patterns: grep -r "new \|malloc" src/
2. `Read` recent commits: git log --since="2 weeks" --grep="memory"
3. `Bash` profile memory: valgrind --leak-check=full ./app
```

---

### Contradiction Detection Engine

**Multi-Level Checking**:

**Level 1: Semantic Contradiction**
```python
# Example detection
T2.3: "Assume database is read-heavy (90% reads)"
T4.1: "Solution requires write-optimized database"
→ Contradiction detected: Read-heavy assumption conflicts with write-optimization
```

**Level 2: Constraint Violation**
```python
T1.2: "Budget constraint: $50,000"
T3.5: "Recommended solution costs $75,000"
→ Constraint violation: Exceeds budget
```

**Level 3: Temporal Inconsistency**
```python
T3.1: "Optimization reduces latency by 50%"
T3.4: "Same optimization increases latency"
→ Temporal contradiction: Inconsistent effect description
```

**Resolution Process**:
1. Flag contradiction with thought IDs
2. Analyze root cause (assumption error, data error, logic error)
3. Create revision branch from earliest affected thought
4. Update reasoning chain
5. Validate downstream thoughts
6. Update confidence levels

## Example: Complex Debugging Session

**Command**:
```bash
/ultra-think "Memory leak in production causing OOM after 6 hours" --framework=root-cause-analysis --depth=deep
```

**Generated Reasoning** (abbreviated):

```markdown
### T1.1 - Planning: Problem Framing
**Dependencies**: None
**Context**: Initial problem statement
**Reasoning**:
- OOM after ~6 hours suggests slow accumulation
- Linear vs exponential growth matters
- 6-hour timeline: ~16% growth per hour if 1GB→6GB
**Confidence**: High (0.90)
**Status**: Active

### T1.2 - Analysis: Gather Evidence
**Dependencies**: [T1.1]
**Evidence**:
- Memory graphs show linear growth pattern
- Growth independent of request load
- All instances affected equally
- Introduced in v2.3.0 (2 weeks ago)
**Confidence**: High (0.95)
**Tools Used**: Monitoring dashboards, git log
**Status**: Active

### T2.1 - Planning: Select Root Cause Framework
**Dependencies**: [T1.2]
**Reasoning**: Classic root cause problem - known symptom, need systematic investigation
**Framework Steps**:
1. Define problem precisely
2. Gather evidence (done in T1.2)
3. Generate hypotheses
4. Test hypotheses
5. Validate root cause
**Confidence**: Very High (0.95)
**Status**: Active

### T3.1 - Analysis: Hypothesis Generation
**Dependencies**: [T2.1, T1.2]
**Hypotheses**:
- H1: Background job not releasing resources (HIGH - linear + load-independent)
- H2: Cache not evicting entries (MEDIUM - linear possible)
- H3: WebSocket connections accumulating (LOW - would correlate with users)
- H4: Logging buffer growth (LOW - usually capped)
**Confidence**: High (0.85)
**Next Steps**: Test H1 first (highest probability)
**Status**: Active

### T3.1.1 - Branch: Test H1 - Background Jobs
**Dependencies**: [T3.1]
**Context**: Investigating background jobs added in v2.3.0
**Analysis**:
- Code review: New analytics job runs every 5 minutes
- Creates large DataFrame objects (pandas)
- No explicit memory cleanup (del, gc.collect())
- Relies on Python GC which doesn't aggressively reclaim memory
**Evidence**:
- Job code: analytics_job.py:47-89
- Memory profiling shows 100MB per execution
- Calculation: 100MB × 12/hour × 6 hours = 7.2GB ✓
**Confidence**: Very High (0.95)
**Status**: Active

### T3.1.2 - Branch: Test H2 - Cache Growth
**Dependencies**: [T3.1]
**Analysis**: No cache configuration changes in v2.3.0
**Confidence**: Low (0.20) - Unlikely root cause
**Status**: Validated (ruled out)

### T4.1 - Synthesis: Root Cause Identified
**Dependencies**: [T3.1.1, T3.1.2]
**Root Cause**: Analytics background job allocates large DataFrames every 5 minutes without explicit cleanup
**Validation**:
- ✅ Timeline matches (introduced in v2.3.0)
- ✅ Growth rate matches (7.2GB over 6 hours)
- ✅ Load-independent (scheduled job)
- ✅ Code review confirms lack of cleanup
**Confidence**: Very High (0.95)
**Contradictions**: None detected
**Status**: Validated

### T5.1 - Validation: Cross-Check Evidence
**Dependencies**: [T4.1]
**Checks**:
- Timeline: v2.3.0 deployed 14 days ago ✓
- Growth rate: Observed 1.2GB/hour matches 100MB×12 ✓
- Independence: No correlation with traffic ✓
- All instances: Job runs on all instances ✓
**Confidence**: Very High (0.98)
**Status**: Validated

### T6.1 - Synthesis: Solution Recommendations
**Dependencies**: [T4.1, T5.1]

**Immediate Fix** (Deploy today):
```python
# In analytics_job.py
def run_analytics():
    df = generate_dataframe()
    process_analytics(df)
    # Add explicit cleanup
    del df
    gc.collect()
```

**Short-term** (This week):
- Add memory monitoring per background job
- Alert on memory growth >10% per hour
- Add memory usage tests in CI

**Long-term** (This month):
- Audit all background jobs for similar patterns
- Establish memory budget guidelines
- Implement automatic memory profiling in staging

**Confidence**: Very High (0.92)
**Status**: Active
```

**Summary Output**:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Ultra-Think Analysis Complete
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Problem: Memory leak causing OOM after 6 hours

Root Cause: Analytics background job (v2.3.0) not releasing DataFrame memory
  - Job runs every 5 minutes
  - Allocates ~100MB per execution
  - Relies on Python GC (insufficient for large objects)
  - Accumulation: 7.2GB over 6 hours

Confidence: 95% (validated through timeline, growth rate, code review)

Recommended Fix:
  1. Add explicit cleanup: del dataframe + gc.collect()
  2. Deploy to canary → validate 12 hours → full rollout
  3. Add memory monitoring per background job
  4. Audit all background jobs for similar patterns

Expected Result: Memory stable at ~1.2GB baseline

Session: ultra-think-20250427-143022
Thoughts: 35 (7 branches explored)
Duration: 47 minutes
Framework: Root Cause Analysis

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Problem Framing
Start with precise, unambiguous problem statement. Avoid vague questions.

### 2. Choose Right Framework
Match framework to problem type - don't force-fit a framework.

### 3. Document Assumptions
Make all assumptions explicit and track them throughout.

### 4. Track Confidence
Assess and update confidence at each thought. Be honest about uncertainty.

### 5. Embrace Branching
Explore alternatives early. Don't commit to first solution prematurely.

### 6. Welcome Revisions
Course-correct when new information emerges. Mark original as superseded.

### 7. Check for Contradictions
Actively seek logical inconsistencies. Run validation phase.

### 8. Synthesize Regularly
Integrate findings at regular intervals (every 10-15 thoughts).

### 9. Validate Before Finalizing
Apply critic agent. Challenge assumptions. Stress-test conclusions.

### 10. Document Journey
Preserve full reasoning path for learning, auditability, and future reference.
