2. **Beta testing**: Selected users (20% traffic)
3. **Canary release**: Gradual increase (20% → 50% → 100%)
4. **Full deployment**: After 7-day monitoring period with success criteria met

### Rollback Procedures
If performance degrades:
1. Monitor for success rate drops >10%
2. Alert team immediately
3. Revert to previous agent versions
4. Analyze root cause
5. Fix and re-test before retry
