# Research Quality Assessment

## Overview

Systematically evaluate scientific research quality across multiple dimensions: methodology soundness, experimental design appropriateness, data quality and sufficiency, statistical rigor, result validity, and publication readiness. This skill provides comprehensive frameworks, checklists, and templates for research evaluation and improvement.

## Core Assessment Dimensions

### 1. Methodology Soundness

Evaluate research methodology for scientific rigor, reproducibility, and appropriateness.

**Key Criteria:**
- Hypothesis clarity and testability
- Method appropriateness for research question
- Control adequacy (baselines, negative/positive controls)
- Reproducibility (code, data, environment specification)
- Statistical validity (assumptions, power, corrections)

For detailed methodology evaluation framework, read `references/methodology_evaluation.md`.

###  2. Experimental Design Quality

Assess experimental design for completeness, coverage, and statistical power.

**Key Aspects:**
- Sample size adequacy and statistical power
- Parameter space coverage and systematic exploration
- Ablation studies completeness
- Baseline comparisons and control conditions
- Replication strategy

For complete experimental design checklist, read `references/experimental_design_checklist.md`.

### 3. Data Quality & Sufficiency

Evaluate data quality, quantity, preprocessing, and bias assessment.

**Key Factors:**
- Data completeness, accuracy, consistency
- Sample size sufficiency for statistical power
- Preprocessing appropriateness and validation
- Bias detection (selection, measurement, sampling)
- Data availability and sharing plans

### 4. Statistical Analysis Rigor

Assess statistical methods, visualization, error analysis, and sensitivity.

**Key Elements:**
- Appropriate statistical tests and assumptions
- Multiple testing correction
- Effect size reporting
- Uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals, error bars)
- Sensitivity and robustness analysis

For statistical analysis guidelines, read `references/statistical_rigor_guide.md`.

### 5. Result Validity & Significance

Evaluate result validity, novelty, and impact.

**Key Considerations:**
- Statistical significance (p-values, confidence intervals)
- Practical significance (effect magnitude, real-world impact)
- Novelty and contribution to field
- Generalizability and limitations
- Comparison to state-of-the-art

### 6. Publication Readiness

Assess manuscript completeness, writing quality, and reproducibility package.

**Key Components:**
- Scientific quality (rigor, novelty, significance)
- Manuscript completeness (all sections present and complete)
- Writing quality (clarity, organization, grammar)
- Figure quality and completeness
- Reproducibility package (code, data, documentation)

For publication readiness checklist, read `references/publication_readiness.md`.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Systematic**: Use checklists to ensure comprehensive coverage
2. **Be Objective**: Base assessments on evidence and established criteria
3. **Be Constructive**: Focus on actionable improvements, not just critique
4. **Quantify When Possible**: Use scores and metrics for clarity
5. **Prioritize Issues**: Flag critical issues (🔴), important (⚠️), and nice-to-have (📋)
6. **Provide Context**: Consider field norms and journal standards
7. **Verify Assumptions**: Check that statistical test assumptions are met
8. **Think Reproducibility**: Assess whether others could replicate the work
9. **Consider Impact**: Evaluate practical significance, not just statistical
10. **Be Thorough**: Don't skip dimensions - weak areas often hide in unchecked sections
