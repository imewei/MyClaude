## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-31

### Enhanced - Agent Performance Optimization

Applied comprehensive Agent Performance Optimization Workflow to the research-intelligence agent using advanced prompt engineering techniques from 2024/2025 best practices.

#### Research-Intelligence Agent Enhancements

**Added Systematic Development Process** (8 steps with self-verification checkpoints):
1. **Analyze Research Requirements Thoroughly**: Identify core research questions, determine scope (systematic review vs exploratory vs forecasting), clarify success criteria (peer-reviewed sources, confidence thresholds, timeframes), identify constraints (budget, timeline, database access)
2. **Design Research Methodology**: Select appropriate research approach (systematic literature review, meta-analysis, trend analysis, competitive intelligence), identify data sources (PubMed, IEEE, arXiv, Google Scholar, industry reports, patents), define search strategies and inclusion/exclusion criteria, plan quality assessment frameworks
3. **Execute Information Discovery**: Use WebSearch and WebFetch for academic database queries with optimized search strings, apply Boolean search operators and semantic search techniques, retrieve literature from multiple sources for cross-validation, document search strategies for reproducibility
4. **Perform Systematic Analysis**: Assess source credibility and publication quality (journal impact factor, peer review status), extract key findings and statistical results, identify patterns and emerging themes, detect biases (publication bias, selection bias, confirmation bias)
5. **Synthesize Evidence-Based Insights**: Integrate findings from multiple sources using structured synthesis methods, identify convergent and divergent findings, generate actionable insights with confidence scores and uncertainty quantification, highlight research gaps and future directions
6. **Validate Research Quality**: Cross-validate findings across independent sources (minimum 3 sources), verify statistical significance and effect sizes, check reproducibility and methodological transparency, assess research ethics and integrity compliance
7. **Document Research Thoroughly**: Create systematic research reports with methodology transparency, include citations and source quality assessments, document limitations and alternative interpretations, provide actionable recommendations
8. **Deliver Strategic Insights**: Present findings in appropriate formats (executive summary, technical report, visualization), highlight practical implications and decision-making guidance, recommend next steps, provide dissemination strategies

Each step includes explicit self-verification questions to ensure quality and rigor.

**Added Quality Assurance Principles** (8 constitutional AI verification checkpoints):
1. **Methodological Rigor**: Applied systematic research methods with transparent documentation
2. **Source Quality**: All sources credible, peer-reviewed (when appropriate), and properly cited
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Research question addressed from multiple perspectives and sources
4. **Bias Mitigation**: Detected and mitigated publication bias, selection bias, and confirmation bias
5. **Statistical Validity**: Statistical claims properly supported with significance testing and effect sizes
6. **Reproducibility**: Search strategy and analysis can be replicated by other researchers
7. **Evidence-Based Conclusions**: All insights grounded in rigorous evidence rather than speculation
8. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Research delivers actionable insights that meet stakeholder needs

**Added Handling Ambiguity Section** with 16 clarifying questions across 4 domains:
- **Research Scope & Objectives** (4 questions): Primary research question, review type (systematic vs exploratory), decision context, source types (peer-reviewed vs industry reports)
- **Methodology & Quality Standards** (4 questions): Time period focus, database priorities, meta-analysis vs qualitative synthesis, quality thresholds
- **Scope & Constraints** (4 questions): Specific domains/regions/populations, budget constraints, timeline requirements, breadth vs depth priorities
- **Output & Deliverables** (4 questions): Format requirements, audience identification, synthesis level needs, research gap inclusions

**Added Tool Usage Guidelines**:
- **Task tool vs direct tools**: Guidance on when to use Explore agent vs direct Read, WebSearch patterns for academic databases, WebFetch for specific papers
- **Parallel vs Sequential Execution**: Run WebSearch queries in parallel for multiple databases (PubMed + IEEE + arXiv), analyze papers independently in parallel, sequential when dependent (search → retrieve → analyze)
- **Agent Delegation Patterns**: Delegate to docs-architect for research paper writing, visualization-interface for dashboards, ml-pipeline-coordinator for ML implementation, hpc-numerical-coordinator for scientific computing
- **Proactive Tool Usage**: Proactively use WebSearch for current literature, Read for paper analysis, cross-validate findings across multiple sources
