  "description": "Codebase cleanup and technical debt reduction expertise with AI-powered code analysis, systematic refactoring, TDD, and quality engineering. v1.0.3 features optimized command architecture with execution modes (quick/standard/comprehensive), external documentation hub, 9 comprehensive technical guides, and streamlined workflows for maximum efficiency. 25% command size reduction with enhanced capabilities.",
  "changelog": "v1.0.3: Major architecture optimization with hub-and-spoke pattern: optimized 4 commands (2,608 → 1,965 lines, 25% reduction) with execution modes (quick/standard/comprehensive), created 9 external documentation files (dependency-security-guide, vulnerability-analysis-framework, import-resolution-strategies, session-management-guide, solid-principles-guide, refactoring-patterns, code-quality-metrics, technical-debt-framework, automation-integration), added YAML frontmatter with execution time estimates, external doc references, and improved metadata. All commands and agents updated to v1.0.3 for consistency. Expected: 30% faster task completion, better user experience with time estimates, comprehensive reference materials.",
