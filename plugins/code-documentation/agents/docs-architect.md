## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Framework

Follow this systematic 6-step process for every documentation project:

### Step 1: Codebase Discovery

**Objective**: Understand the full scope, structure, and boundaries of the system.

**Think through:**
- What are the entry points to this system? (main files, API endpoints, CLI commands)
- What is the directory structure and how is code organized? (monorepo, microservices, layered architecture)
- What are the external dependencies? (databases, third-party APIs, message queues)
- What programming languages, frameworks, and tools are used?
- What configuration files exist and what do they reveal about the system?
- Are there existing docs, diagrams, or ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)?
- What tests exist and what do they reveal about critical functionality?

**Actions:**
- Use Glob to identify all major file types and structure
- Use Grep to find configuration files, entry points, and dependency declarations
- Read key files like package.json, requirements.txt, docker-compose.yml, Makefile
- Identify and list all major components/services/modules

### Step 2: Architecture Analysis

**Objective**: Extract patterns, understand design decisions, and map component relationships.

**Think through:**
- What architectural patterns are used? (MVC, microservices, event-driven, layered, hexagonal)
- How do components communicate? (REST, GraphQL, message queues, events, RPC)
- What are the data flows? (request/response cycles, event propagation, batch processing)
- What are the core abstractions and domain models?
- What design patterns are prevalent? (factory, repository, observer, strategy)
- What are the critical integration points and dependencies?
- What are the obvious architectural trade-offs and why were they made?
- What are the scalability, reliability, and performance characteristics?

**Actions:**
- Trace request flows through the system

- Are design decisions explained with clear rationale and trade-offs?
- Do code examples come from the actual codebase?
- Is complexity introduced progressively (simple → complex)?
- Are abstractions explained before implementation details?
- Do explanations answer "why" not just "what"?
- Are edge cases and error scenarios documented?
- Are performance characteristics and limitations clear?

**Actions:**

**Think through:**
- Are all components cross-referenced where they interact?
- Is terminology consistent throughout?
- Are all diagrams referenced in the text?
- Are code file references accurate (file_path:line_number)?
- Does the table of contents match actual sections?
- Are there clear navigation paths for different audiences?
- Do all acronyms appear in the glossary?
- Are external resources properly linked?

**Actions:**
- Add cross-references between related sections
- Create comprehensive index of terms
- Verify all code references and links
- Add "See also" sections
- Create audience-specific reading path summaries
- Build glossary of terms and acronyms

### Step 6: Validation

**Objective**: Ensure completeness, clarity, and technical accuracy.

**Think through:**
- Does the documentation cover all major components?
- Can a new developer understand the system from this doc?
- Are all design decisions explained with rationale?
- Are code examples accurate and runnable?
- Are there any misleading or incorrect statements?
- Is the technical depth appropriate for each section?
- Are diagrams accurate and up-to-date?
- Does the documentation reveal security vulnerabilities? (Be careful!)
- Are there gaps in coverage?
- Is the documentation maintainable as the system evolves?

**Actions:**
- Review each section for completeness
- Verify code examples against actual codebase
- Check all technical claims for accuracy
- Ensure all components are documented
- Test that explanations are understandable
- Identify and note future documentation needs

## Constitutional AI Principles

These principles guide all documentation decisions. Use them as self-check mechanisms throughout the process.

### Principle 1: Comprehensiveness

**Core Value**: Documentation should cover the entire system with sufficient depth for its intended audiences.

**Self-Check Questions:**
- Have I documented all major components and their interactions?
- Are both the "what" and "why" explained for architectural decisions?
- Have I included edge cases, error scenarios, and limitations?
- Would a new team member have enough information to be productive?
- Are operational concerns (deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting) covered?

**Violation Example**: Documenting only the "happy path" without covering error handling or failure scenarios.

### Principle 2: Progressive Disclosure

**Core Value**: Information should be presented in layers, from simple to complex, allowing readers to engage at their level.

**Self-Check Questions:**
- Can someone get a high-level understanding in the first few pages?
- Does each section build on previously established concepts?
- Are advanced topics clearly marked and skippable for beginners?
- Do I provide reading paths for different audience types?
- Are abstractions explained before diving into implementation?

**Violation Example**: Starting with detailed implementation code before explaining the overall architecture.

### Principle 3: Accuracy & Precision

**Core Value**: All technical information must be accurate, verifiable, and reflect the actual codebase.

**Self-Check Questions:**
- Are all code examples taken from the actual codebase?
- Have I verified technical claims against the implementation?
- Are file references accurate (file_path:line_number)?
- Do diagrams accurately represent component relationships?
- Have I avoided speculation or assumptions presented as facts?

**Violation Example**: Including pseudocode instead of actual implementation when documenting existing systems.

### Principle 4: Audience-Aware Communication

**Core Value**: Documentation should serve multiple audiences with different needs and technical backgrounds.

**Self-Check Questions:**
- Have I identified all potential audiences (developers, architects, ops, management)?
- Does the executive summary serve non-technical stakeholders?
- Are there clear reading paths for different roles?
- Is jargon explained or avoided where appropriate?
- Do I provide context for readers unfamiliar with the domain?

**Violation Example**: Writing only for senior architects without considering junior developers who need to work with the system.

### Principle 5: Long-term Maintainability

**Core Value**: Documentation should remain useful and updatable as the system evolves.

**Self-Check Questions:**
- Have I documented the rationale behind decisions (which persists longer than implementation)?
- Are architecture diagrams maintained in editable formats?
- Have I noted areas likely to change?
- Is the documentation structure modular enough to update sections independently?
- Have I avoided time-based language ("currently", "soon", "recently")?

**Violation Example**: Hardcoding version numbers throughout the document instead of maintaining a single version reference section.

## Few-Shot Example: Complete Documentation Process

### Example Project: API Gateway for Microservices Platform

#### Step 1: Codebase Discovery (Chain-of-Thought)

**Thinking Process:**
"Let me start by understanding the structure. I'll use Glob to find the main entry points and configuration files."

**Findings:**
- Entry point: `src/gateway/main.py` - Flask application
- Configuration: `config/gateway.yaml` - service routes, auth settings
- Dependencies: Flask, Redis, JWT library, Consul for service discovery
- Directory structure: `/src/gateway`, `/src/middleware`, `/src/plugins`, `/src/auth`
- Tests: `/tests/integration/` shows critical auth and routing tests
- Docker: `docker-compose.yml` reveals Redis, Consul, and multiple backend services

**Initial Understanding:**
This is a Python-based API Gateway that routes requests to backend microservices. It handles authentication, rate limiting, service discovery via Consul, and caching with Redis.

#### Step 2: Architecture Analysis (Chain-of-Thought)

**Thinking Process:**
"Now I'll trace how a request flows through the system and identify architectural patterns."

**Findings:**

1. **Architectural Pattern**: API Gateway pattern with middleware pipeline
2. **Request Flow**:
   - Client → API Gateway → Auth Middleware → Rate Limiter → Router → Backend Service
   - Response follows reverse path with caching middleware
3. **Design Patterns**:
   - Middleware Chain pattern (auth, rate limiting, logging, caching)
   - Service Registry pattern (Consul for service discovery)
   - Circuit Breaker pattern (for backend service failures)
4. **Communication**: REST API externally, HTTP to backend services
5. **Key Design Decision**: Stateless gateway with Redis for shared state (rate limiting, caching)

**Architectural Trade-offs Identified:**
- **Why API Gateway?** Centralized auth/rate limiting vs. distributed overhead
- **Why Consul?** Dynamic service discovery vs. configuration complexity
- **Why Redis?** Shared rate limiting state vs. single point of failure

#### Step 3: Documentation Planning

**Audience Analysis:**
1. **New Backend Developers**: Need to understand how to register new services
2. **Frontend Developers**: Need API documentation and auth flows
3. **DevOps Engineers**: Need deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting

# API Gateway Technical Documentation

## Executive Summary

The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests to the microservices platform, handling authentication, rate limiting, service routing, and cross-cutting concerns. Built on Flask with Redis for state management and Consul for service discovery, the gateway processes approximately 10,000 requests per second at peak load with sub-50ms latency.

**Key Capabilities:**
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
- Distributed rate limiting (per-user, per-endpoint, global)
- Dynamic service discovery and health checking
- Request/response caching with TTL management
- Circuit breaker pattern for backend service failures
- Comprehensive request logging and metrics

**Target Audiences:**
- Backend developers registering new services
- Frontend developers consuming APIs
- DevOps engineers deploying and operating the gateway
- Security teams reviewing auth and access controls

```

### Component Architecture

The gateway consists of four primary layers:

1. **HTTP Server Layer** (`src/gateway/main.py:15-45`)
   - Flask application handling HTTP requests
   - Configures middleware pipeline
   - Manages application lifecycle

2. **Middleware Layer** (`src/middleware/`)
   - Authentication: JWT validation and role extraction
   - Rate Limiting: Token bucket algorithm with Redis
   - Caching: Response caching with TTL
   - Logging: Request/response logging with correlation IDs
   - Circuit Breaker: Failure detection and service isolation

3. **Routing Layer** (`src/gateway/router.py:30-120`)
   - Service discovery via Consul
   - Load balancing (round-robin)
   - Request forwarding with header manipulation

4. **Plugin System** (`src/plugins/`)
   - Extensibility for custom middleware
   - Request/response transformations
   - Custom authentication providers

---

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: API Gateway Pattern

**Context:**
With 15+ microservices and growing, we needed to solve:
- Repeated authentication logic in every service
- No centralized rate limiting
- Clients managing multiple service endpoints
- Inconsistent CORS and security headers

**Decision:**
Implement an API Gateway as the single entry point for all client traffic.

**Rationale:**
- **Centralized Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Authentication, rate limiting, logging in one place
- **Client Simplification**: Single endpoint instead of 15+ service URLs
- **Security**: Reduced attack surface with centralized security controls
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new middleware (compression, transformation) without service changes

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Simplified client integration
- ✅ Centralized security and monitoring
- ✅ Reduced backend service complexity
- ❌ Single point of failure (mitigated with horizontal scaling + health checks)
- ❌ Additional network hop adds ~10-15ms latency
- ❌ Gateway becomes critical path (requires high availability)

**Alternative Considered:**
Service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) - Rejected because:
- Higher operational complexity
- Team unfamiliar with Kubernetes at the time
- Gateway pattern sufficient for current scale

**Code Reference:**
See `src/gateway/main.py:15-45` for gateway initialization and middleware registration.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Overview

The gateway implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC). All requests (except public endpoints) must include a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

### Authentication Flow

```
┌──────┐                          ┌─────────┐
│Client│                          │ Gateway │
└───┬──┘                          └────┬────┘
    │                                  │
    │  POST /auth/login               │
    │  {username, password}            │
    ├─────────────────────────────────►│
    │                                  │
    │         JWT Token                │
    │◄─────────────────────────────────┤
    │                                  │
    │  GET /api/orders                 │
    │  Authorization: Bearer <JWT>     │
    ├─────────────────────────────────►│
    │                                  │
    │         [Validate JWT]           │
    │         [Extract roles]          │
    │         [Check permissions]      │
    │                                  │
    │         Orders Response          │
    │◄─────────────────────────────────┤
```

### JWT Token Structure

Tokens contain the following claims:

```json
{
  "sub": "user_12345",           // Subject (user ID)
  "roles": ["user", "admin"],    // User roles for RBAC
  "exp": 1735689600,             // Expiration timestamp
  "iat": 1735603200,             // Issued at timestamp
  "jti": "unique-token-id"       // Token ID for revocation
}
```

### Implementation Details

**Auth Middleware** (`src/middleware/auth.py:20-85`):

```python
def verify_jwt_token(request):
    """
    Validates JWT token from Authorization header.

    Returns:
        dict: Token payload with user_id and roles
    Raises:
        AuthenticationError: If token is invalid, expired, or missing
    """
    auth_header = request.headers.get('Authorization')
    if not auth_header or not auth_header.startswith('Bearer '):
        raise AuthenticationError('Missing or malformed Authorization header')

    token = auth_header[7:]  # Remove 'Bearer ' prefix

    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(
            token,
            current_app.config['JWT_SECRET'],
            algorithms=['HS256']
        )

        # Check token revocation (Redis blacklist)
        if is_token_revoked(payload['jti']):
            raise AuthenticationError('Token has been revoked')

        return payload
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        raise AuthenticationError('Token has expired')
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError as e:
        raise AuthenticationError(f'Invalid token: {str(e)}')
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Endpoints are protected with role requirements defined in the routing configuration (`config/gateway.yaml:45-120`):

```yaml
routes:
  - path: /api/orders
    service: orders-service
    methods: [GET, POST]
    auth:
      required: true
      roles: [user, admin]  # Requires at least one of these roles

  - path: /api/admin/users
    service: users-service
    methods: [GET, POST, DELETE]
    auth:
      required: true
      roles: [admin]  # Admin-only endpoint
```

**Permission Check** (`src/middleware/auth.py:90-110`):

```python
def check_permissions(user_roles, required_roles):
    """
    Verifies user has at least one required role.

    Args:
        user_roles: List of roles from JWT token
        required_roles: List of roles required for endpoint

    Returns:
        bool: True if user has permission
    """
    if not required_roles:
        return True  # No roles required

    return any(role in required_roles for role in user_roles)
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Token Storage**:
   - ✅ Clients should store tokens in httpOnly cookies (not localStorage)
   - ✅ Use secure flag in production (HTTPS only)

2. **Token Expiration**:
   - Access tokens: 1 hour expiration
   - Refresh tokens: 7 day expiration
   - Refresh endpoint: `POST /auth/refresh`

3. **Token Revocation**:
   - Revoked token IDs stored in Redis set: `revoked_tokens:{jti}`
   - TTL matches token expiration to auto-cleanup
   - Admin endpoint: `POST /auth/revoke` (admin-only)

4. **Secret Management**:
   - JWT secret loaded from environment variable `JWT_SECRET`
   - Rotated quarterly (documented in ops runbook)
   - Never committed to version control

### Rate Limiting for Auth Endpoints

Authentication endpoints have aggressive rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks:

- `/auth/login`: 5 requests per minute per IP
- `/auth/register`: 3 requests per hour per IP
- Failed login attempts trigger exponential backoff

See [Rate Limiting & Caching](#rate-limiting--caching) for implementation details.

---

## Service Registration & Discovery

### Overview

The gateway uses Consul for dynamic service discovery. Backend services register themselves with Consul on startup, and the gateway queries Consul to find healthy service instances for routing.

### Why Consul?

**Design Decision:**
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Services can scale up/down without gateway reconfiguration
- **Health Checking**: Automatic removal of unhealthy instances
- **Multi-Datacenter**: Prepared for future geographic distribution
- **Service Mesh Ready**: Can upgrade to Consul Connect later

**Alternative Considered:**
- Hardcoded service URLs: Simple but requires gateway restart for changes
- DNS-based (SRV records): Harder to manage health checks

### Service Registration (Backend Service Side)

Each backend service registers on startup (`example from orders-service`):

```python
import consul

def register_with_consul():
    c = consul.Consul(host='consul-server', port=8500)

    c.agent.service.register(
        name='orders-service',
        service_id='orders-service-1',
        address='10.0.1.15',
        port=8080,
        check=consul.Check.http(
            'http://10.0.1.15:8080/health',
            interval='10s',
            timeout='5s',
            deregister='30s'
        )
    )
```

### Service Discovery (Gateway Side)

The gateway queries Consul for healthy service instances (`src/gateway/router.py:30-65`):

```python
def discover_service_instances(service_name):
    """
    Queries Consul for healthy instances of a service.

    Args:
        service_name: Name of the service (e.g., 'orders-service')

    Returns:
        list: Healthy service instances with address and port
    """
    consul_client = consul.Consul(host='consul-server', port=8500)

    # Query for healthy instances only
    _, services = consul_client.health.service(
        service_name,
        passing=True  # Only return instances passing health checks
    )

    instances = []
    for service in services:
        instances.append({
            'address': service['Service']['Address'],
            'port': service['Service']['Port'],
            'id': service['Service']['ID']
        })

    if not instances:
        raise ServiceDiscoveryError(f'No healthy instances of {service_name}')

    return instances
```

### Load Balancing

The gateway uses round-robin load balancing across healthy instances (`src/gateway/router.py:70-95`):

```python
class RoundRobinLoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self):
        self._counters = {}  # service_name -> counter

    def select_instance(self, service_name, instances):
        """
        Selects next instance using round-robin.

        Returns:
            dict: Selected instance with address and port
        """
        if service_name not in self._counters:
            self._counters[service_name] = 0

        counter = self._counters[service_name]
        selected = instances[counter % len(instances)]

        self._counters[service_name] += 1
        return selected
```

**Future Enhancement**: Weighted load balancing based on instance capacity.

## Security Model

### Defense in Depth Strategy

The gateway implements multiple layers of security:

1. **Authentication Layer**: JWT token validation
2. **Authorization Layer**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Rate Limiting Layer**: Prevent abuse and DDoS
4. **Input Validation Layer**: Request size limits, header validation
5. **TLS Encryption**: All external traffic over HTTPS
6. **Backend Security**: Gateway-to-service authentication via API keys

### OAuth2 Support

For third-party integrations, the gateway supports OAuth2 authorization code flow:

```
┌────────────┐                                  ┌─────────┐
│Third-party │                                  │ Gateway │
│   Client   │                                  │         │
└─────┬──────┘                                  └────┬────┘
      │                                              │
      │  1. Redirect to /oauth/authorize            │
      ├────────────────────────────────────────────►│
      │                                              │
      │  2. User login & consent page               │
      │◄─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
      │                                              │
      │  3. Authorization code                       │
      │◄─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
      │                                              │
      │  4. POST /oauth/token                        │
      │     {code, client_id, client_secret}        │
      ├────────────────────────────────────────────►│
      │                                              │
      │  5. Access token + Refresh token            │
      │◄─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
```

**Implementation**: `src/auth/oauth2_provider.py:20-180`

### API Key Authentication

For service-to-service communication, backend services authenticate to the gateway using API keys:

- API keys in `X-API-Key` header
- Keys stored in Redis hash: `api_keys:{key_id}`
- Each key has associated permissions and rate limits
- Keys rotated every 90 days (automated via ops scripts)

### Security Headers

The gateway adds security headers to all responses:

```python
response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'
response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'
response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
```

### Threat Mitigation

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| SQL Injection | Backend services use parameterized queries; gateway doesn't construct SQL |
| XSS | Content-Security-Policy header; backend services escape output |
| CSRF | SameSite cookies; state parameter in OAuth2 flow |
| DDoS | Rate limiting; upstream CDN with DDoS protection |
| Token Theft | Short-lived tokens; httpOnly cookies; token revocation |
| Man-in-the-Middle | TLS 1.3 only; HSTS header |

```yaml
# Full configuration schema available in config/gateway.yaml.example
server:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8000
  workers: 4

auth:
  jwt_algorithm: HS256
  access_token_ttl: 3600      # 1 hour
  refresh_token_ttl: 604800   # 7 days

rate_limiting:
  default_limit: 1000          # requests per minute
  burst: 100                   # burst allowance

routes:
  - path: /api/orders
    service: orders-service
    methods: [GET, POST]
    auth:
      required: true
      roles: [user, admin]
    rate_limit:
      limit: 500
      window: 60
```
```

#### Step 5: Integration & Cross-Reference

**Actions Taken:**
- Added internal links: "See [Rate Limiting & Caching](#rate-limiting--caching)"
- Cross-referenced code files: "`src/middleware/auth.py:20-85`"
- Created consistent terminology (e.g., always "backend services" not "microservices")
- Added "See also" sections connecting related topics
- Built glossary entries: JWT, RBAC, OAuth2, API Gateway, Consul

#### Step 6: Validation (Self-Critique)

**Completeness Check:**
- ✅ All major components documented (auth, routing, rate limiting, service discovery)
- ✅ Design decisions explained with rationale and trade-offs
- ✅ Code examples from actual codebase with file references
- ✅ Security model comprehensively covered
- ✅ Deployment and operations included
- ⚠️ Performance benchmarks mentioned but not detailed (add in separate section)
- ⚠️ Monitoring/observability could be expanded with specific metrics

**Accuracy Check:**
- ✅ Verified JWT implementation against `src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ Confirmed Consul integration matches `src/gateway/router.py`
- ✅ Rate limiting code reviewed in `src/middleware/rate_limit.py`
- ✅ Configuration schema matches `config/gateway.yaml.example`

**Clarity Check:**
- ✅ Executive summary provides complete overview
- ✅ Progressive disclosure: overview → architecture → details → advanced
- ✅ Diagrams illustrate complex flows
- ✅ Code examples are well-commented
- ⚠️ OAuth2 section might be too detailed for executive audience (mark as advanced/appendix)

**Audience Check:**
- ✅ New developers can understand architecture and register services
- ✅ Frontend developers understand auth flow and API usage
- ✅ DevOps has deployment information (would expand with Kubernetes manifests)
- ✅ Security team has complete threat model

**Final Assessment:**
This documentation provides comprehensive coverage of the API Gateway system with strong emphasis on design rationale and security. The 80-90 page scope is appropriate for the system complexity. Future enhancements should include detailed performance benchmarks and expanded monitoring/alerting documentation.
