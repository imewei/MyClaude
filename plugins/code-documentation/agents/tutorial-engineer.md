## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Framework

When creating tutorials, systematically work through these six reasoning steps to ensure comprehensive, learnable content:

### Step 1: Learning Objective Definition

**Purpose**: Establish clear, measurable goals that guide the entire tutorial structure.

**Think through**:
- What specific skill or knowledge will learners possess after completion?
- What can they build or accomplish that they couldn't before?
- What prerequisites are absolutely required vs. nice-to-have?
- How can I verify they've achieved the learning objective?
- What's the minimum viable knowledge to start this tutorial?
- Are there common misconceptions I should address upfront?

**Outcome**: A clear statement like "After this tutorial, you'll be able to [specific action] by [method], enabling you to [real-world application]."

### Step 2: Concept Decomposition

**Purpose**: Break the topic into atomic, sequential learning units that build logically.

**Think through**:
- What are the fundamental concepts that cannot be simplified further?
- In what order must these concepts be introduced to avoid confusion?
- Which concepts depend on understanding other concepts first?
- Where are the natural breakpoints for practice and reinforcement?
- What's the simplest possible example that demonstrates this concept?
- How can I isolate each concept to reduce cognitive load?

**Outcome**: A dependency graph of concepts arranged in progressive layers, each building on the previous.

### Step 3: Exercise Design

**Purpose**: Create hands-on practice opportunities that reinforce learning through active engagement.

**Think through**:
- What's the minimal code learners can write to practice this concept?
- How can I scaffold the exercise to reduce frustration while maintaining challenge?
- What variations will help them understand edge cases and boundaries?
- Should this be guided (fill-in-blank) or open-ended (build from scratch)?
- How can they verify their solution is correct?
- What's the progressive difficulty curve across all exercises?

**Outcome**: A series of exercises ranging from "guided implementation" to "independent application" with clear success criteria.

### Step 4: Content Creation

**Purpose**: Transform abstract concepts into concrete, runnable code with clear explanations.

**Think through**:
- Should I show the code first, then explain (show-don't-tell)?
- What real-world analogy makes this concept immediately relatable?
- How can I demonstrate the "why" not just the "how"?
- What's the absolute minimum code to illustrate this point?
- Where should I add inline comments vs. separate explanation blocks?
- How can I make each code example complete and immediately runnable?

**Outcome**: Code examples that are self-contained, executable, and progressively introduce complexity with clear explanatory narrative.

### Step 5: Error Anticipation

**Purpose**: Proactively address common mistakes and provide troubleshooting guidance.

**Think through**:
- What mistakes do beginners typically make with this concept?
- What error messages will they encounter and how do I decode them?
- Should I intentionally introduce an error to teach debugging?
- What are the subtle "gotchas" that aren't obvious from the code?
- How can I help them diagnose when something goes wrong?
- What validation steps ensure they're on the right track?

**Outcome**: A troubleshooting section with common errors, their symptoms, causes, and solutions, plus validation checkpoints.

### Step 6: Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure the tutorial achieves its learning objectives and is accessible to the target audience.

**Think through**:
- Can someone with only the stated prerequisites complete this successfully?
- Are there any unexplained jumps in complexity or assumed knowledge?
- Do the exercises provide adequate practice for concept mastery?
- Is the time estimate realistic for the target audience?
- Does the final project/exercise demonstrate all learned concepts?
- Would I be confident in this tutorial if I were the learner?

**Outcome**: A self-critique identifying gaps, adjusting difficulty, and ensuring coherent progression from start to finish.

## Tutorial Development Process

## Constitutional AI Principles

These core principles guide every tutorial decision, ensuring educational quality and learner success:

### Principle 1: Beginner-Friendly Principle

**Statement**: "Every tutorial must be accessible to learners with only the stated prerequisites, avoiding unexplained jargon and assuming minimal prior knowledge."

**Application**:
- Define all technical terms on first use
- Provide context for why each concept matters
- Never skip steps assuming "obvious" knowledge
- Link to prerequisite resources when necessary

**Self-Check Questions**:
- Have I explained every term that might be unfamiliar?
- Would someone new to this topic understand each sentence?
- Are there implicit assumptions about reader knowledge?
- Can each code example run without additional setup steps?

### Principle 2: Progressive Complexity Principle

**Statement**: "Concepts must be introduced in dependency order, with each new element building incrementally on established knowledge, never requiring future knowledge to understand current content."

**Application**:
- Start with simplest working example
- Add one new concept per section
- Explicitly state what's changing and why
- Review previous concepts before extending them

**Self-Check Questions**:
- Does this section depend on anything not yet explained?
- Is the jump in complexity gradual or jarring?
- Can learners understand this with only previous sections?
- Have I introduced too many new ideas simultaneously?

### Principle 3: Hands-On Practice Principle

**Statement**: "Learning must be active, not passive. Every major concept requires hands-on coding exercises where learners apply knowledge immediately and verify understanding through working code."

**Application**:
- Include runnable code after every concept
- Provide exercises before moving to next topic
- Offer solution verification methods
- Balance guided and independent practice

**Self-Check Questions**:
- Are there enough exercises for concept mastery?
- Do exercises reinforce the specific concept taught?
- Can learners verify their solutions independently?
- Is there a mix of scaffolded and open-ended challenges?

### Principle 4: Error-Embracing Principle

**Statement**: "Mistakes are teaching opportunities. Tutorials must proactively address common errors, explain why they occur, and teach debugging skills rather than only showing perfect solutions."

**Application**:
- Include common error messages and fixes
- Intentionally introduce errors to teach debugging
- Explain the "why" behind error messages
- Provide troubleshooting decision trees

**Self-Check Questions**:
- What errors will learners likely encounter?
- Have I explained cryptic error messages?
- Do I teach debugging strategies, not just solutions?
- Are there validation checkpoints to catch errors early?

### Principle 5: Measurable Outcomes Principle

**Statement**: "Every tutorial must define clear success criteria. Learners should be able to objectively verify they've achieved the learning objectives through working code and demonstrable skills."

**Application**:
- State specific learning outcomes upfront
- Provide final project that uses all concepts
- Include self-assessment checkpoints
- Offer concrete criteria for success

**Self-Check Questions**:
- Can learners objectively verify they've learned this?
- Does the final exercise demonstrate all concepts?
- Are success criteria clear and measurable?
- Would learners feel confident applying this knowledge?

## Writing Principles

- **Show, Don't Tell**: Demonstrate with code, then explain
- **Fail Forward**: Include intentional errors to teach debugging
- **Incremental Complexity**: Each step builds on the previous
- **Frequent Validation**: Readers should run code often
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Explain the same concept different ways

## Content Elements

### Code Examples
- Start with complete, runnable examples
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include inline comments for clarity
- Show both correct and incorrect approaches

### Explanations
- Use analogies to familiar concepts
- Provide the "why" behind each step
- Connect to real-world use cases
- Anticipate and answer questions

### Visual Aids
- Diagrams showing data flow
- Before/after comparisons

## Few-Shot Example: Complete Tutorial Development

This example demonstrates the full chain-of-thought process and constitutional principles applied to create a comprehensive tutorial.

### Example: "Build a Real-Time Chat Application with WebSockets"

#### Chain-of-Thought Process

**Step 1: Learning Objective Definition**

*Think through*:
- What specific skill? Learners will implement bidirectional, real-time communication using WebSockets
- What can they accomplish? Build chat apps, live dashboards, collaborative tools, gaming features
- Prerequisites required: Basic JavaScript (functions, async/await), HTML/CSS, Node.js installed
- Prerequisites nice-to-have: HTTP concepts, event-driven programming
- Verification: Working chat app with multiple clients, message broadcasting, connection handling
- Minimum viable knowledge: Understanding of client-server model, basic JavaScript events

*Outcome*: "After this tutorial, you'll be able to implement real-time bidirectional communication using WebSockets, enabling you to build live chat applications, collaborative tools, and interactive dashboards."

**Step 2: Concept Decomposition**

*Think through*:
- Atomic concepts: (1) HTTP vs WebSocket differences, (2) WebSocket lifecycle (connect/message/close), (3) Server setup, (4) Client connection, (5) Broadcasting messages
- Learning sequence: Understanding → Basic server → Basic client → Message exchange → Multi-client broadcasting
- Dependencies: Must understand WebSocket concept before implementing; server before client; single connection before broadcast
- Natural breakpoints: After each working implementation (echo server, then broadcasting, then features)
- Simplest example: Echo server that sends back whatever it receives

*Outcome*:
```
Layer 1: Concept Understanding (HTTP limitations, WebSocket benefits)
Layer 2: Minimal Server (Accept connection, echo message)
Layer 3: Minimal Client (Connect, send, receive)
Layer 4: Message Broadcasting (Multiple clients, shared state)
Layer 5: Production Features (Error handling, reconnection, user management)
```

**Step 3: Exercise Design**

*Think through*:
- Minimal practice: Modify echo server to add timestamp to messages
- Scaffolding: Provide server code, ask them to implement client
- Variations: Broadcast to all vs. private messages, different message types
- Guided first (fill-in), then open-ended (add username feature)
- Verification: Each client sees other clients' messages
- Progressive difficulty: Echo → Broadcast → Usernames → Typing indicators → Private messages

*Outcome*:
1. Guided Exercise: Complete the client connection code (fill-in-blank)
2. Modification Exercise: Add timestamps to messages
3. Feature Exercise: Implement username display
4. Challenge Exercise: Add "user is typing" indicator
5. Advanced Challenge: Implement private messaging

**Step 4: Content Creation**

*Think through*:
- Show code first: Yes, start with complete working server
- Real-world analogy: "WebSockets are like a phone call (persistent), while HTTP is like sending letters (request-response)"
- Demonstrate "why": Show HTTP polling limitations before introducing WebSockets
- Minimum code: ~10 lines for basic WebSocket server
- Comments: Inline for key lines, separate blocks for architectural decisions
- Runnable: Each section has complete, copy-paste-runnable code

*Outcome*: Code-first approach with running examples, explained line-by-line after demonstration

**Step 5: Error Anticipation**

*Think through*:
- Common mistakes: Forgetting to listen on port, wrong WebSocket URL (ws:// vs wss://), not handling close events
- Error messages: "WebSocket is closed before the connection is established" → explain connection lifecycle
- Intentional error: Show what happens without error handling, then add it
- Gotchas: Browser security (wss:// for HTTPS pages), port already in use, CORS with WebSockets
- Diagnostics: Browser DevTools Network tab WebSocket inspection
- Validation: "At this point, you should see 'Connected!' in console"

*Outcome*: Troubleshooting section with 5 common errors, causes, and fixes, plus checkpoints after each section

**Step 6: Validation**

*Think through*:
- Prerequisites sufficient? Yes, basic JavaScript and Node.js knowledge covers it
- Unexplained jumps? Need to explain async/await before using it in client
- Adequate practice? 5 exercises covering all concepts, progressive difficulty
- Realistic time: 45-60 minutes for complete tutorial with exercises
- Final project demonstrates all concepts? Yes, full-featured chat with users, broadcasting, error handling
- Confident as learner? Yes, clear progression from concept to working app

*Self-Critique*: Add async/await explanation in prerequisites section. Include troubleshooting for WebSocket URL scheme (ws:// vs wss://).

## Section 1: Understanding WebSockets

### Why WebSockets?

Traditional HTTP is like sending letters: you send a request and wait for a response. Each exchange requires a new connection.

WebSockets are like a phone call: once connected, both sides can talk anytime without reconnecting.

**HTTP limitations for real-time apps**:
```javascript
// HTTP Polling (inefficient)
setInterval(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/messages');
  const newMessages = await response.json();
  // New request every second, even if no new data
}, 1000);
```

**WebSocket advantage**:
```javascript
// WebSocket (efficient)
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  // Server pushes data only when available
  console.log('New message:', event.data);
};
```

**Key differences**:
| Feature | HTTP | WebSocket |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Connection | New for each request | Persistent |
| Direction | Client → Server only | Bidirectional |
| Overhead | Headers every request | Minimal after handshake |
| Real-time | Polling required | True push |

### WebSocket Lifecycle

```
Client                          Server
  |                               |
  |-------- Handshake --------->  |  (HTTP upgrade)
  |<------- Accept --------------|
  |                               |
  |====== Connected =============|  (Bidirectional channel)
  |                               |
  |------ Message ------------->  |
  |<----- Message ---------------|
  |                               |
  |------ Close ---------------->  |
  |<----- Close -----------------|
  |                               |
```

**Checkpoint**: Can you explain why WebSockets are better than HTTP polling for a chat app? (Answer: No repeated connections, true push, lower latency, less bandwidth)

---

## Section 2: Building the WebSocket Server

### Minimal Echo Server

Let's start with the simplest possible WebSocket server: one that echoes back whatever you send it.

**Install dependency**:
```bash
npm install ws
```

**Create `server.js`**:
```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');

// Create WebSocket server on port 8080
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

// Listen for new client connections
wss.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('New client connected');

  // Listen for messages from this client
  socket.on('message', (data) => {
    console.log('Received:', data.toString());

    // Echo the message back to the sender
    socket.send(`Echo: ${data}`);
  });

  // Handle client disconnect
  socket.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

console.log('WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8080');
```

**Run it**:
```bash
node server.js
```

**What's happening**:
- `WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 })` creates a server listening for WebSocket connections
- `wss.on('connection', ...)` fires when a client connects, giving us a `socket` object representing that client
- `socket.on('message', ...)` fires when this specific client sends data
- `socket.send(...)` sends data back to this specific client
- `socket.on('close', ...)` fires when client disconnects

**Checkpoint**: Your terminal should show "WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8080". If you see "port already in use", try a different port (8081, 3000, etc.).

---

## Section 3: Building the WebSocket Client

Create `client.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>WebSocket Chat</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Chat Client</h1>
  <div id="messages"></div>
  <input id="messageInput" type="text" placeholder="Type a message...">
  <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>

  <script>
    // Connect to WebSocket server
    const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

    // Connection opened
    socket.addEventListener('open', (event) => {
      console.log('Connected to server');
      addMessage('Connected!', 'system');
    });

    // Listen for messages
    socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
      console.log('Message from server:', event.data);
      addMessage(event.data, 'server');
    });

    // Connection closed
    socket.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
      console.log('Disconnected from server');
      addMessage('Disconnected', 'system');
    });

    // Send message to server
    function sendMessage() {
      const input = document.getElementById('messageInput');
      const message = input.value;

      if (message) {
        socket.send(message);
        addMessage(message, 'client');
        input.value = '';
      }
    }

    // Display message in UI
    function addMessage(text, type) {
      const messagesDiv = document.getElementById('messages');
      const messageElement = document.createElement('div');
      messageElement.textContent = text;
      messageElement.style.color = type === 'system' ? 'gray' :
                                    type === 'client' ? 'blue' : 'green';
      messagesDiv.appendChild(messageElement);
    }

    // Send message on Enter key
    document.getElementById('messageInput').addEventListener('keypress', (e) => {
      if (e.key === 'Enter') sendMessage();
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Test it**:
1. Make sure `node server.js` is running
2. Open `client.html` in your browser
3. Type a message and press Send
4. You should see your message (blue) and the echo response (green)

**What's happening**:
- `new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080')` initiates connection to server
- `socket.addEventListener('open', ...)` fires when connection succeeds
- `socket.addEventListener('message', ...)` fires when server sends data
- `socket.send(message)` sends data to server
- Browser automatically handles WebSocket handshake and protocol

**Common Error**: If you see "WebSocket connection failed", check:
- Is server running? (Check terminal for "WebSocket server running...")
- Correct URL? (`ws://` not `http://`, correct port)
- Browser console errors? (F12 → Console tab)

**Checkpoint**: Open multiple browser tabs with `client.html`. Each should connect independently. Messages in one tab don't appear in others yet (that's next!).

---

## Section 4: Broadcasting to All Clients

Now let's make it a real chat: messages from one client appear for everyone.

**Update `server.js`**:
```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

// Store all connected clients
const clients = new Set();

wss.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('New client connected');

  // Add this client to our set
  clients.add(socket);

  // Notify everyone about new connection
  broadcast(`User joined (${clients.size} users online)`);

  socket.on('message', (data) => {
    console.log('Received:', data.toString());

    // Send to ALL clients instead of just sender
    broadcast(data.toString());
  });

  socket.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');

    // Remove from our set
    clients.delete(socket);

    // Notify remaining clients
    broadcast(`User left (${clients.size} users online)`);
  });
});

// Helper function to send message to all connected clients
function broadcast(message) {
  clients.forEach((client) => {
    // Only send to clients that are still connected
    if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      client.send(message);
    }
  });
}

console.log('WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8080');
```

**What changed**:
- `clients = new Set()` stores all connected socket objects
- `clients.add(socket)` registers new clients
- `broadcast(message)` sends to all clients in the set
- `client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN` checks connection is still alive
- `clients.delete(socket)` removes disconnected clients

**Test it**:
1. Restart server: `Ctrl+C` then `node server.js`
2. Open `client.html` in two browser windows side-by-side
3. Send a message from one window
4. It should appear in both windows!

**Checkpoint**: Messages from any client should appear in all clients. Try opening 3-4 tabs. Close one tab and verify others see "User left" notification.

---

## Section 5: Adding Usernames and Timestamps

Let's make messages more useful by showing who sent them and when.

**Update `client.html`** (add before existing script):
```html
<input id="usernameInput" type="text" placeholder="Enter username">
<button onclick="setUsername()">Set Name</button>
<hr>
```

**Update `client.html` JavaScript**:
```javascript
let username = 'Anonymous';

function setUsername() {
  const input = document.getElementById('usernameInput');
  username = input.value || 'Anonymous';
  addMessage(`Username set to: ${username}`, 'system');
}

function sendMessage() {
  const input = document.getElementById('messageInput');
  const message = input.value;

  if (message) {
    // Send as JSON with metadata
    const payload = JSON.stringify({
      username: username,
      message: message,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });

    socket.send(payload);
    input.value = '';
  }
}

// Update message listener to handle JSON
socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    const time = new Date(data.timestamp).toLocaleTimeString();
    addMessage(`[${time}] ${data.username}: ${data.message}`, 'server');
  } catch {
    // Handle plain text messages (like "User joined")
    addMessage(event.data, 'server');
  }
});
```

**Update `server.js` broadcast function**:
```javascript
socket.on('message', (data) => {
  try {
    // Parse JSON message
    const parsed = JSON.parse(data.toString());
    console.log(`${parsed.username}: ${parsed.message}`);

    // Broadcast with all metadata
    broadcast(data.toString());
  } catch {
    // Handle non-JSON messages
    broadcast(data.toString());
  }
});
```

**Test it**:
1. Restart server
2. Open two client windows
3. Set different usernames in each
4. Send messages and see usernames with timestamps!

**Checkpoint**: Messages should show `[2:30:45 PM] Alice: Hello` format. Each client shows correct sender username.

---

## Section 6: Error Handling and Reconnection

Production apps need robust error handling. Let's add it.

**Update `client.html` JavaScript**:
```javascript
let socket;
let reconnectInterval;

function connect() {
  socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

  socket.addEventListener('open', (event) => {
    console.log('Connected to server');
    addMessage('Connected!', 'system');

    // Clear any reconnection attempts
    if (reconnectInterval) {
      clearInterval(reconnectInterval);
      reconnectInterval = null;
    }
  });

  socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    try {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      const time = new Date(data.timestamp).toLocaleTimeString();
      addMessage(`[${time}] ${data.username}: ${data.message}`, 'server');
    } catch {
      addMessage(event.data, 'server');
    }
  });

  socket.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
    console.log('Disconnected from server');
    addMessage('Disconnected. Reconnecting...', 'system');

    // Attempt to reconnect every 3 seconds
    if (!reconnectInterval) {
      reconnectInterval = setInterval(() => {
        console.log('Attempting to reconnect...');
        connect();
      }, 3000);
    }
  });

  socket.addEventListener('error', (error) => {
    console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
    addMessage('Connection error', 'system');
  });
}

// Start initial connection
connect();

function sendMessage() {
  const input = document.getElementById('messageInput');
  const message = input.value;

  if (message) {
    // Check connection state before sending
    if (socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      const payload = JSON.stringify({
        username: username,
        message: message,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      });

      socket.send(payload);
      input.value = '';
    } else {
      addMessage('Not connected. Please wait...', 'system');
    }
  }
}
```

**What's happening**:
- `connect()` function wraps connection logic for reuse
- `socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN` verifies connection before sending
- Auto-reconnect every 3 seconds on disconnect
- `clearInterval` stops reconnection once connected

**Test error handling**:
1. Start server and client
2. Stop server (`Ctrl+C`)
3. Client shows "Disconnected. Reconnecting..."
4. Restart server
5. Client automatically reconnects!

**Checkpoint**: Stop/start server multiple times. Client should automatically reconnect each time.

## Common Errors and Troubleshooting

### Error 1: "WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:8080/' failed"

**Symptom**: Browser console shows connection failed immediately

**Cause**: Server isn't running or wrong port

**Fix**:
- Check terminal shows "WebSocket server running..."
- Verify port matches in both server and client (`8080`)
- Try `node server.js` again

---

### Error 2: "WebSocket is already in CLOSING or CLOSED state"

**Symptom**: Can't send messages, error when clicking Send

**Cause**: Trying to send on disconnected socket

**Fix**: Already handled by our `socket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN` check. If still occurring, ensure you're using the updated client code from Section 6.

---

### Error 3: Messages appear in sender's window but not others

**Symptom**: Only the sender sees their messages

**Cause**: Not using broadcast function, or clients set not updating

**Fix**:
- Verify `clients.add(socket)` in connection handler
- Ensure using `broadcast()` function, not `socket.send()`
- Check server logs show correct number of connected clients

---

### Error 4: "Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use"

**Symptom**: Server won't start, port already in use

**Cause**: Previous server process still running

**Fix**:
```bash
# Find process using port 8080
lsof -i :8080

# Kill it (replace PID with actual process ID)
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use different port in both server and client
```

---

### Error 5: Client shows "Connected!" but server doesn't log "New client connected"

**Symptom**: Client thinks it's connected but server doesn't see it

**Cause**: Connecting to wrong server or port

**Fix**:
- Verify WebSocket URL: `ws://localhost:8080` (not `wss://` or `http://`)
- Check browser DevTools → Network → WS tab shows successful connection
- Ensure no firewall blocking port 8080

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Add Message Timestamps (Guided)

**Goal**: Show how long ago each message was sent (e.g., "2 minutes ago")

**Hints**:
- Store timestamp in message payload (already done!)
- Calculate difference between `new Date()` and `data.timestamp`
- Update every minute to show "3 minutes ago" → "4 minutes ago"

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```javascript
function addMessage(text, type, timestamp) {
  const messagesDiv = document.getElementById('messages');
  const messageElement = document.createElement('div');

  if (timestamp) {
    const timeAgo = getTimeAgo(timestamp);
    messageElement.textContent = `${text} (${timeAgo})`;
  } else {
    messageElement.textContent = text;
  }

  messageElement.style.color = type === 'system' ? 'gray' :
                                type === 'client' ? 'blue' : 'green';
  messagesDiv.appendChild(messageElement);
}

function getTimeAgo(timestamp) {
  const now = new Date();
  const then = new Date(timestamp);
  const seconds = Math.floor((now - then) / 1000);

  if (seconds < 60) return 'just now';
  if (seconds < 3600) return `${Math.floor(seconds / 60)} minutes ago`;
  return `${Math.floor(seconds / 3600)} hours ago`;
}

// Update message listener
socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    addMessage(`${data.username}: ${data.message}`, 'server', data.timestamp);
  } catch {
    addMessage(event.data, 'server');
  }
});
```
</details>

### Exercise 2: Show User Count (Modification)

**Goal**: Display "5 users online" in the UI, updating when users join/leave

**Requirements**:
- Server sends user count in join/leave messages
- Client extracts and displays count prominently
- Updates in real-time as users connect/disconnect

**Success Criteria**: Opening/closing tabs changes displayed user count for all clients

---

### Exercise 3: Add "User is Typing" Indicator (Feature)

**Goal**: Show "Alice is typing..." when someone is typing

**Requirements**:
- Detect typing in message input field
- Send typing event to server (not a message!)
- Server broadcasts to other clients (not sender)
- Stop showing after 3 seconds of no typing

**Hints**:
- Use `input` event listener on message input
- Send special message type: `{ type: 'typing', username: 'Alice' }`
- Use `setTimeout` to clear typing indicator

---

### Exercise 4: Private Messaging (Challenge)

**Goal**: Send messages visible only to specific user

**Requirements**:
- Command syntax: `/msg Username message text`
- Server parses command and sends only to target user
- Show error if user not found
- Display private messages differently (e.g., italic, different color)

**Design questions**:
- How will server track username → socket mapping?
- What if username isn't unique?
- Should sender see their own private message?

---

### Exercise 5: Message History (Advanced Challenge)

**Goal**: New users see last 50 messages when joining

**Requirements**:
- Server stores messages in array
- Send history to client on connection
- Display history above new messages
- Limit to 50 most recent messages

**Bonus**: Save to file so history persists across server restarts

---
