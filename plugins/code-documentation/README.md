## Examples

### Example 1: React Authentication Component Security Review

**Request:** "Review this LoginForm component for security vulnerabilities and performance issues"

**code-reviewer v2.0.0 Response:**
```
## Step 1: Code Assessment & Context Understanding
- Purpose: User authentication component
- Language: React/JavaScript
- Complexity: Medium (100 lines, 3 state hooks)
- Risk Level: CRITICAL (handles user credentials)
- Deployment: Production web application
- Blast Radius: All users (authentication affects entire app)

## Step 2: Automated Analysis Execution
Running automated tools:
- ESLint: 2 warnings (unused variables)
- SonarQube: Code smells detected (complexity score: 8)
- Snyk: 1 dependency vulnerability (react-dom@17.0.1)
- npm audit: 0 critical vulnerabilities

## Step 3: Manual Code Review
Logic Analysis:
‚úì Form submission properly handled
‚úó Missing input validation before submission
‚úó Error handling incomplete (no network error recovery)

## Step 4: Security & Performance Deep Dive

CRITICAL Security Issues:
1. XSS-Vulnerable Token Storage
   - Location: line 42: localStorage.setItem('token', response.token)
   - Risk: Accessible to JavaScript, vulnerable to XSS attacks
   - Fix: Use httpOnly cookies instead

2. Missing Input Validation
   - Location: handleSubmit function (line 30)
   - Risk: No validation before API call
   - Fix: Validate email format and password requirements

3. Missing CSRF Protection
   - Location: API call (line 38)
   - Risk: Cross-site request forgery vulnerability
   - Fix: Implement CSRF token in headers

Performance Issues:
- Unnecessary re-renders on every keystroke (no debouncing)
- Memory leak potential (missing cleanup in useEffect)

## Step 5: Actionable Feedback Generation

BLOCKING (Must fix before merge):
1. Fix XSS token storage vulnerability
   [Complete code example with httpOnly cookie implementation]

2. Add input validation
   [Complete code example with validation logic]

HIGH PRIORITY:
3. Add CSRF protection
   [Complete code example with CSRF token]

NICE-TO-HAVE:
4. Optimize re-renders
   [Complete code example with useMemo/useCallback]

## Step 6: Review Validation & Completeness Check
‚úì All security areas covered (OWASP Top 10 checked)
‚úì Performance analyzed (rendering, memory)
‚úì Code examples provided for each issue
‚úì Severity levels assigned
‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: Add accessibility review in follow-up

Final Summary:
- 2 BLOCKING security issues (estimated fix: 2-3 hours)

### Example 2: Microservices API Gateway Documentation

**Request:** "Create comprehensive documentation for our API Gateway system with service discovery and rate limiting"

**docs-architect v2.0.0 Response:**
```
## Step 1: Codebase Discovery
Analyzing structure...
- Entry point: src/gateway/server.js
- Core components: 8 identified (routing, auth, rate-limiting, service-discovery, etc.)
- Dependencies: Express.js, Consul, Redis, JWT
- Integrations: 12 backend microservices

## Step 2: Architecture Analysis
Key patterns identified:
- API Gateway pattern (centralized entry point)
- Service Registry pattern (Consul for discovery)
- Circuit Breaker pattern (Hystrix-like implementation)
- Rate Limiting (Redis-based token bucket)

Design decisions extracted:
- Why API Gateway? (centralized authentication, rate limiting, single entry point)
- Why Consul? (vs. Eureka, etcd - dynamic service registration, health checks)
- Why Redis? (vs. Memcached - atomic operations for rate limiting)

## Step 3: Documentation Planning
Target audience: 5 personas
1. Backend Developers (implementation details, API contracts)
2. Frontend Developers (API usage, authentication)
3. DevOps Engineers (deployment, scaling, monitoring)
4. Security Team (authentication, authorization, threat model)
5. Management (architecture overview, capabilities)

Planned structure: 80-90 pages
- Executive Summary (2 pages)
- Architecture Overview (15 pages)
- Design Decisions (12 pages)
- Component Deep-Dives (35 pages)
- Security Model (10 pages)
- Deployment & Operations (8 pages)

### Design Decisions

#### Decision 1: API Gateway Pattern
**Context**: Multiple microservices needed centralized authentication and rate limiting

**Rationale**:
- Centralized authentication reduces code duplication across 12 services
- Single point for rate limiting prevents distributed state issues
- Simplified client integration (one endpoint vs. 12)

**Trade-offs**:
- ‚úì Pros: Centralized control, simplified client code, better security
- ‚úó Cons: Single point of failure, potential bottleneck, added latency

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Backend for Frontend (BFF): Rejected due to multiple client types
- Direct service access: Rejected due to security and rate limiting concerns

### Example 3: WebSocket Real-Time Chat Tutorial

**Request:** "Create a beginner tutorial for building a real-time chat application with WebSockets"

**tutorial-engineer v2.0.0 Response:**
```
## Step 1: Learning Objective Definition
What learners will achieve:
- Understand WebSocket protocol and bidirectional communication
- Build complete real-time chat server and client
- Handle connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
- Implement broadcasting to multiple clients
- Debug common WebSocket issues

Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed (v14+)
- Basic JavaScript knowledge (functions, callbacks)
- HTML/CSS fundamentals
- Terminal/command line comfort

Measurable Outcome: Working chat application with 3+ concurrent users

## Step 2: Concept Decomposition
Atomic concepts in learning order:
1. HTTP vs WebSocket (request-response vs persistent connection)
2. WebSocket server setup (ws library, event handlers)
3. WebSocket client connection (browser API, message sending)
4. Broadcasting pattern (maintaining client list, iterating connections)
5. Message metadata (usernames, timestamps, formatting)
6. Error handling (connection loss, server crashes, edge cases)

## Step 3: Exercise Design
Progressive hands-on exercises:
- Section 2: Modify echo server to uppercase messages
- Section 3: Add button to send messages (guided)
- Section 4: Filter messages by keyword (challenge)
- Section 5: Add emoji support (advanced)
- Final: Implement private messaging (synthesis)

## Step 4: Content Creation

# Tutorial: Build a Real-Time Chat Application with WebSockets

**Time Estimate**: 45-60 minutes
**Difficulty**: Beginner
**Final Result**: Multi-user chat with usernames and timestamps

## Section 1: Understanding WebSockets

**Key Concept**: WebSockets enable real-time, bidirectional communication

HTTP (Traditional):
- Client asks, server answers
- New connection for each request
- Higher latency (connection overhead)

WebSocket:
- Persistent connection
- Both sides can send anytime
- Lower latency (single connection)

## Section 2: Building a Minimal Echo Server

Let's start with the simplest WebSocket server (15 lines):

```javascript
// server.js
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  console.log('Client connected');

  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log('Received:', message);
    ws.send(`Echo: ${message}`); // Send back to same client
  });

  ws.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

console.log('WebSocket server running on ws://localhost:8080');
```

**Run it**: `node server.js`
**Checkpoint**: You should see "WebSocket server running..."

## Section 3: Building WebSocket Client

[HTML + JavaScript client implementation]

## Section 4: Broadcasting to All Clients

[Broadcasting pattern with client list]

## Section 5: Adding Usernames and Timestamps

[Metadata and formatting]

## Section 6: Error Handling and Reconnection

[Robust connection management]

## Common Errors and Troubleshooting

**Error 1: "WebSocket is not defined"**
- Symptom: Browser console error
- Root Cause: Older browser without WebSocket support
- Fix: Add polyfill or check for WebSocket support

[4 more common errors with complete solutions]

## Practice Exercises

**Exercise 1: Add Message Timestamps (Guided)**
Modify the client to display when each message was sent.

Hint: Use `new Date().toLocaleTimeString()`

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```javascript
// In message event handler:
const timestamp = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
const div = document.createElement('div');
div.textContent = `[${timestamp}] ${data}`;
messages.appendChild(div);
```
</details>

[4 more exercises with solutions]

## Summary
