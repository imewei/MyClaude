## Comprehensive Few-Shot Example: Authentication System Code Review

### Scenario
Pull request reviewing authentication system changes with OAuth2 implementation, JWT token handling, and session management updates. The code contains security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and maintainability concerns.

### Code Under Review (Simplified)

```python

            return False
```

### Step 1: Code Understanding

**Analysis:**
The code implements a custom authentication system with user registration, login, and session management. It uses SQLite for persistence and MD5 hashing for password storage. The system generates session tokens by hashing username and timestamp combinations. The code structure is a single class with methods for each authentication operation.

**Key Observations:**
- Direct database interaction without ORM
- Custom session management without JWT or OAuth2 standards
- Password hashing using weak MD5 algorithm
- SQL query building with string concatenation (no parameterization)
- Database connection created once during initialization
- Simple token generation without cryptographic randomness

---

### Step 2: Quality Assessment

**Critical Quality Issues:**

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability** (Cyclomatic Complexity Issue)
   - All database queries use string interpolation instead of parameterized queries
   - Example: `f"INSERT INTO users (username, password, email) VALUES ('{username}', '{hashed}', '{email}')"`
   - Attacker could input: `'; DROP TABLE users; --` as username

2. **Weak Password Hashing**
   - MD5 is cryptographically broken and should never be used for passwords
   - No salt implementation for password hashing
   - Vulnerable to rainbow table attacks

3. **Insecure Token Generation**
   - Session token is deterministic and predictable
   - Uses `time.time()` which has low entropy
   - No cryptographic randomness in token generation
   - Token length and strength undefined

4. **Code Duplication**
   - SQL query logic repeated across methods
   - Database cursor operations not abstracted

5. **Error Handling**
   - Generic exception handling with print statements
   - No logging for security events
   - Errors exposed to caller without sanitization

---

### Step 3: Security Analysis

**Critical Security Vulnerabilities:**

1. **SQL Injection (Critical - OWASP Top 10 #3)**
   ```
   Risk Level: CRITICAL
   Impact: Complete database compromise, unauthorized access
   Example Attack: username="admin'--", password="anything"
   ```

2. **Broken Authentication (Critical - OWASP Top 10 #2)**
   ```
   Risk Level: CRITICAL
   Issues:
   - Weak password hashing (MD5)
   - No password complexity requirements
   - No rate limiting on authentication attempts
   - Sessions not properly invalidated
   ```

3. **Cryptographic Failure (Critical - OWASP Top 10 #2)**
   ```
   Risk Level: CRITICAL
   Issues:
   - MD5 hashing is cryptographically broken
   - Passwords stored without salt
   - Vulnerable to offline brute force attacks
   - Token generation uses weak randomness
   ```

4. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (High)**
   ```
   Risk Level: HIGH
   Issues:
   - No audit trail of authentication attempts
   - No alerting on suspicious activity
   - Failed login attempts not tracked
   - Session creation/revocation not logged
   ```

5. **Session Management Issues (High)**
   ```
   Risk Level: HIGH
   Issues:
   - Sessions stored in same database as user data
   - No mechanism to invalidate all sessions for user
   - Expired sessions never cleaned up from database
   - Session fixation vulnerability possible
   ```

6. **Missing Input Validation (High)**
   ```
   Risk Level: HIGH
   Issues:
   - No email format validation
   - No username format validation
   - No password complexity requirements
   - No check for account lockout after failed attempts
   ```

---

### Step 4: Performance Review

**Performance Concerns:**

1. **Database Connection Management**
   - Single persistent connection could become a bottleneck
   - No connection pooling for concurrent requests
   - No timeout configuration on database operations

2. **Query Inefficiencies**
   - No indexes defined on username/email fields
   - Session expiration cleanup never runs (accumulates stale data)
   - N+1 potential in `get_user_by_session` with join

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Database cursor not closed explicitly
   - Exception handling could leak resources
   - No cleanup mechanism for expired sessions

4. **Scalability Limitations**
   - SQLite suitable for single-process only
   - No support for distributed sessions
   - Thread-safety concerns with shared database connection

---

### Step 5: Recommendations

**Priority 1 - Critical Security Fixes (Must Fix Before Merge):**

1. **Implement Parameterized Queries**
   ```python
   # BEFORE (Vulnerable):
   self.cursor.execute(f"SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{hashed}'")

   # AFTER (Secure):
   self.cursor.execute("SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (username, hashed))
   ```

2. **Replace MD5 with bcrypt**
   ```python
   import bcrypt

   # Password hashing
   hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12))

   # Password verification
   bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode(), stored_hash)
   ```

3. **Generate Secure Random Tokens**
   ```python
   import secrets

   # BEFORE:
   session_id = hashlib.md5(f"{username}{time.time()}".encode()).hexdigest()

   # AFTER:
   session_id = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
   ```

**Priority 2 - Important Improvements (Address Soon):**

4. **Add Security Logging & Monitoring**
   ```python
   import logging

   security_logger = logging.getLogger("security")

   def authenticate(self, username: str, password: str):
       # ... authentication logic ...
       if not user:
           security_logger.warning(f"Failed login attempt for user: {username}")
           return None
       security_logger.info(f"Successful login for user: {username}")
   ```

5. **Implement Account Lockout Protection**
   ```python
   def authenticate(self, username: str, password: str):
       # Check failed login attempts
       failed_attempts = self.get_failed_login_count(username)
       if failed_attempts > 5:
           security_logger.warning(f"Account locked: {username}")
           return None
       # ... rest of authentication
   ```

6. **Add Input Validation**
   ```python
   import re

   def validate_email(self, email: str) -> bool:
       pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
       return re.match(pattern, email) is not None

   def validate_password(self, password: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
       if len(password) < 12:
           return False, "Password must be at least 12 characters"
       if not any(c.isupper() for c in password):
           return False, "Password must contain uppercase letters"
       if not any(c.isdigit() for c in password):
           return False, "Password must contain digits"
       return True, ""
   ```

7. **Cleanup Expired Sessions**
   ```python
   def cleanup_expired_sessions(self):
       """Remove expired sessions from database"""
       self.cursor.execute("DELETE FROM sessions WHERE expires_at < datetime('now')")
       self.db.commit()
   ```

**Priority 3 - Minor Improvements (Nice to Have):**

8. **Add Database Indexes**
   ```python
   def setup_database(self):
       # ... table creation ...
       self.cursor.execute("CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_username ON users(username)")
       self.cursor.execute("CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_session_id ON sessions(id)")
       self.cursor.execute("CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_expires_at ON sessions(expires_at)")
   ```

9. **Implement Connection Pooling & Context Management**
   ```python
   from contextlib import contextmanager

   @contextmanager
   def get_db_cursor(self):
       try:
           yield self.cursor
       finally:
           self.db.commit()
   ```

10. **Add Type Hints Throughout**
    ```python
    def create_user(self, username: str, password: str, email: str) -> bool:
        """Create a new user account."""
    ```
