- Current load: 5M orders/year
- Target: 50M orders/year (10x growth)
- Issues: Slow releases (monthly), tight coupling, scaling difficulties

## Step 2: Pattern Analysis
Recommended Patterns:
- Microservices architecture with domain-driven design
- Event-driven communication via Kafka
- API Gateway for routing and authentication
- Service Mesh (Istio) for observability and resilience

## Step 3: Design Review
Service Decomposition (8 microservices):
1. Orders Service - Order management and lifecycle
2. Inventory Service - Stock management and availability
3. Payments Service - Payment processing via Stripe
4. Users Service - Authentication and user profiles
5. Catalog Service - Product catalog and search
6. Notifications Service - Email/SMS notifications
7. Analytics Service - Reporting and dashboards
8. Shipping Service - Logistics and tracking

### Example 2: Authentication System Security Review

**Request:** "Review this authentication implementation for security vulnerabilities and suggest improvements"

**code-reviewer v1.0.1 Response:**
```
## Step 1: Code Understanding
Current Implementation:
- Login endpoint accepting username/password
- Database query for user authentication
- Token generation for session management

## Step 2: Quality Assessment
Code Quality: Moderate
- Clear variable naming
- Missing error handling
- No input validation

## Step 3: Security Analysis
CRITICAL Security Vulnerabilities Found:

1. **SQL Injection (CVSS 9.8)**
   Location: Line 25 - String concatenation in SQL query
   Impact: Full database compromise, 50K+ user records at risk
   Fix: Use parameterized queries with SQLAlchemy ORM

2. **Weak Cryptography (CVSS 8.1)**
   Location: Line 28 - MD5 password hashing
   Impact: Password cracking via rainbow tables
   Fix: Use bcrypt with 12 salt rounds

3. **Insecure Token Generation (CVSS 7.5)**
   Location: Line 32 - Base64 encoding of username:timestamp
   Impact: Token prediction and session hijacking
   Fix: Use secure JWT tokens with RS256 signing

## Step 4: Performance Review
Performance Issues:
- Sequential database queries (can be parallelized)
- No caching for frequently accessed user data
- Missing rate limiting (DDoS vulnerability)

## Step 5: Test Validation
Test Coverage: 0% (NO TESTS FOUND)
Required Tests:
- Valid login with correct credentials
- Invalid login with wrong password
- SQL injection attempt (should be blocked)
- Rate limiting enforcement

## Step 6: Feedback Synthesis
Priority Recommendations:

üî¥ CRITICAL (Must fix before deployment):
1. Fix SQL injection with parameterized queries
2. Replace MD5 with bcrypt password hashing
3. Implement secure JWT token generation

üü° IMPORTANT (Should address):
4. Add rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
5. Implement comprehensive test coverage (target: 80%)

üü¢ NICE-TO-HAVE:
6. Add password strength validation
7. Implement MFA support for sensitive accounts

Refactored Code Example:
[Complete secure implementation with all fixes provided]

Maturity Assessment: 91/100 after implementing all fixes
```
