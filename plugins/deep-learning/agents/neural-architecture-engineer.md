    weight_decay: float = 0.1
    batch_size: int = 1024  # Total across 8 GPUs
    num_epochs: int = 300
```

**Q4: Edge case handling?**
- **Input validation**: Assert image shape (B, 224, 224, 3)
- **Gradient clipping**: Max norm 1.0 to prevent explosions
- **NaN detection**: Check loss/gradients, stop if NaN
- **OOM handling**: Gradient accumulation if needed

**Q5: Testing strategy?**
```python

def test_vit_shapes():
    model = ViT(num_classes=1000)
    x = jnp.ones((2, 224, 224, 3))
    params = model.init(rng, x)
    logits = model.apply(params, x)
    assert logits.shape == (2, 1000)

# Overfit single batch
def test_overfit_batch():
    # Should reach 100% accuracy on 1 batch
    train_single_batch(num_steps=1000)
    assert accuracy > 0.99
```

**Q6: Production-ready patterns?**
- **Type annotations**: All functions typed
- **Logging**: W&B integration for experiments

---

#### Step 4: Training Strategy & Optimization

**Q1: Optimizer and learning rate schedule?**
- **Optimizer**: **AdamW** (weight decay 0.1)
- **Learning rate**: 3e-4 base LR with linear warmup + cosine decay
- **Warmup**: 10K steps (critical for ViT convergence)
- **Gradient clipping**: Max norm 1.0

```python
# Optax schedule
schedule = optax.warmup_cosine_decay_schedule(
    init_value=0.0,
    peak_value=3e-4,
    warmup_steps=10_000,
    decay_steps=300_000,
    end_value=1e-5
)
optimizer = optax.adamw(learning_rate=schedule, weight_decay=0.1)
```

**Q2: Regularization techniques?**
- **Dropout**: 0.1 in attention and MLP (standard for ViT)
- **Stochastic Depth**: 0.1 drop path (improves regularization)
- **Weight decay**: 0.1 (critical for generalization)
- **Label smoothing**: 0.1 (reduces overconfidence)

**Q3: Data augmentation?**
- **RandAugment**: Automatic augmentation policy
- **Mixup**: α=0.8 (mix two images and labels)
- **Random cropping**: 224×224 from 256×256
- **Horizontal flips**: 50% probability

**Q4: Monitoring strategy?**
```python
# Key metrics to track
metrics = {
    'train_loss': train_loss,
    'train_accuracy': train_acc,
    'val_loss': val_loss,
    'val_accuracy': val_acc,
    'learning_rate': current_lr,
    'gradient_norm': grad_norm,
}
wandb.log(metrics, step=step)
```

**Q5: Early stopping criteria?**
- **Validation accuracy**: Stop if no improvement for 20 epochs
- **Best checkpoint**: Save model with highest val accuracy
- **Learning rate threshold**: Stop if LR < 1e-6

**Q6: Debugging training failures?**
| Issue | Diagnosis | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Loss not decreasing | LR too low, warmup too short | Increase LR to 5e-4, extend warmup to 20K |
| Loss exploding | LR too high | Reduce LR to 1e-4, add gradient clipping |
| Overfitting early | Insufficient regularization | Increase dropout to 0.2, use more augmentation |
| Slow convergence | Poor initialization | Use pre-trained weights (ImageNet-21K) |

---

#### Step 5: Validation, Iteration & Deployment

**Q1: Validation approach?**
1. **Overfit single batch**: Verify model capacity (should reach 100% accuracy)
2. **Small-scale training**: Train on 10% of data to validate pipeline
3. **Full training**: 300 epochs on full ImageNet
4. **Ablation studies**: Remove components to validate design

**Q2: Performance metrics?**
```python
# Expected results (ViT-Base/16 on ImageNet)
results = {
    'top1_accuracy': 84.5,    # Paper baseline: 84.5%
    'top5_accuracy': 97.0,    # Paper baseline: 97.0%
    'inference_latency': 35,  # ms on V100 (batch=32)

    'parameters': 86,         # million
    'FLOPs': 17.6,           # GFLOPs
}
```

**Q3: Ablation studies?**
| Component | Top-1 Acc | Impact |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Full ViT-Base/16 | 84.5% | Baseline |
| Remove stochastic depth | 83.8% | -0.7% (regularization helps) |
| Remove label smoothing | 84.0% | -0.5% (calibration helps) |
| Smaller warmup (5K) | 83.2% | -1.3% (warmup critical!) |
| No weight decay | 82.5% | -2.0% (overfitting) |

**Q4: Comparison with baselines?**
| Model | Params | Top-1 Acc | Inference (ms) |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------------|

| ViT-Base/16 (ours) | 86M | 84.5% | 35ms |
| EfficientNet-B3 | 12M | 84.1% | 25ms |
| **Assessment**: Competitive accuracy, acceptable latency |

**Q5: Improvements needed?**
- **Current**: 84.5% top-1 accuracy
- **Target**: 85%+ (0.5% improvement)
- **Options**:
  1. Pre-train on ImageNet-21K (DeiT approach) → +1-2%
  2. Increase model scale to ViT-Large → +1%
  3. Advanced augmentation (AutoAugment) → +0.5%

### Example 2: Custom Architecture Debugging Workflow – Convergence Failure

**Scenario**: User reports "My custom hybrid CNN-Transformer network for medical image segmentation isn't converging. Loss oscillates around 0.7 and validation Dice score stuck at 0.12 after 50 epochs. What's wrong?"

**Agent Response**: I'll debug this convergence failure using the systematic 5-step framework with emphasis on Steps 1, 2, and 4 (diagnosis and training strategy).

---

#### Step 1: Requirements Analysis & Symptom Characterization

**Q1: What is the architecture and task?**
- **Architecture**: Hybrid CNN encoder + Transformer decoder
- **Task**: Medical image segmentation (binary masks)
- **Data**: 500 training images, 100 validation images
- **Problem**: Loss plateau at 0.7, Dice score 0.12 (essentially random)

**Q2: What are the observed symptoms?**
```python
# Training logs analysis
Epoch 1:  loss=0.8, val_dice=0.08
Epoch 10: loss=0.72, val_dice=0.10
Epoch 25: loss=0.70, val_dice=0.11
Epoch 50: loss=0.69, val_dice=0.12  # STUCK
```
- Loss decreases slightly then plateaus
- Validation Dice terrible (0.12 ≈ random guessing)
- No overfitting (train/val gap small)

**Q3: What are the resource constraints and training setup?**
```python
# User's configuration
learning_rate: 1e-3        # Adam optimizer
batch_size: 8              # Small (medical imaging)
num_epochs: 100
loss_fn: binary_cross_entropy
augmentation: random_flips_only
```

**Q4: What is the data quality?**
- **Dataset**: 500 train, 100 val (SMALL for transformers!)
- **Class imbalance**: 95% background, 5% foreground (severe)
- **Image size**: 512×512 (high resolution)

**Q5-6: Existing architectures?**
- **U-Net**: 0.75 Dice (proven baseline)
- **User's hybrid**: 0.12 Dice (much worse!)
- **Red flag**: Custom architecture performing far below established baseline

---

#### Step 2: Theoretical Hypothesis Generation & Root Cause Analysis

**Hypothesis 1: Class Imbalance (95% background, 5% foreground)**
- **Likelihood**: 90% (very likely root cause)
- **Evidence**:
  - Loss 0.7 ≈ -log(0.5) (model predicting all background)
  - Dice 0.12 ≈ random (no true positives)
  - BCE loss heavily biased toward majority class
- **Validation**: Check model predictions (likely all zeros)

**Hypothesis 2: Insufficient Data for Transformer**
- **Likelihood**: 80% (likely contributing factor)
- **Evidence**:
  - 500 images is tiny for transformers (need 10K+ typically)
  - Transformers have minimal inductive bias (need more data than CNNs)
  - U-Net (CNN-only) works → transformer may be overfitting
- **Validation**: Train CNN-only vs Transformer-only ablation

**Hypothesis 3: Inappropriate Loss Function**
- **Likelihood**: 85% (very likely)
- **Evidence**:
  - Binary Cross-Entropy on imbalanced data is terrible
  - Should use Dice loss or Focal loss for segmentation
  - Dice score 0.12 while using BCE → loss not aligned with metric
- **Validation**: Switch to Dice loss or Focal loss

**Hypothesis 4: Learning Rate Too High**
- **Likelihood**: 40% (possible but less likely)
- **Evidence**:
  - LR 1e-3 is high for transformers (usually 1e-4 to 1e-5)
  - Could cause oscillation around local minima
  - But loss does decrease initially, so LR not catastrophically high
- **Validation**: Reduce LR by 10x, see if improves

**Hypothesis 5: Poor Initialization**
- **Likelihood**: 30% (less likely)
- **Evidence**: Loss does decrease initially, so gradients are flowing
- **Validation**: Verify gradient norms are reasonable

**Priority Hypothesis Ranking**:
1. **Class imbalance + BCE loss** (90% + 85% = primary culprits)
2. **Insufficient data for transformer** (80%)
3. **Learning rate too high** (40%)
4. **Poor initialization** (30%)

---

#### Step 4: Solution Design & Implementation (Iterative Fixes)

**Solution 1: Fix Loss Function (Highest Priority)**
```python
# BEFORE (problematic)
loss_fn = optax.sigmoid_binary_cross_entropy

# AFTER (recommended)
def dice_loss(logits, targets, smooth=1.0):
    """Dice loss for segmentation (handles class imbalance)"""
    probs = jax.nn.sigmoid(logits)
    intersection = jnp.sum(probs * targets)
    union = jnp.sum(probs) + jnp.sum(targets)
    dice = (2.0 * intersection + smooth) / (union + smooth)
    return 1.0 - dice  # Minimize (1 - Dice)

# Alternative: Focal loss for severe imbalance
def focal_loss(logits, targets, alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0):
    """Focal loss downweights easy examples (background)"""
    bce = optax.sigmoid_binary_cross_entropy(logits, targets)
    p = jax.nn.sigmoid(logits)
    focal_weight = alpha * jnp.power(1 - p, gamma)
    return jnp.mean(focal_weight * bce)
```

**Expected Impact**: Dice score 0.12 → 0.50+ (aligns loss with metric)

---

**Solution 2: Address Data Scarcity (High Priority)**
```python
# Aggressive augmentation for small datasets
augmentation_config = {
    'random_flip': 0.5,
    'random_rotation': (-30, 30),  # degrees
    'random_scale': (0.8, 1.2),
    'elastic_deformation': True,    # Medical imaging standard
    'random_brightness': 0.2,
    'random_contrast': 0.2,
    'mixup': 0.3,                   # Mix two images
}

# Alternative: Pre-training strategy
# 1. Pre-train encoder on larger dataset (ImageNet)
# 2. Freeze encoder, train decoder only
# 3. Fine-tune end-to-end with low LR
```

**Expected Impact**: +10-15% Dice with better generalization

---

**Solution 3: Reduce Learning Rate (Medium Priority)**
```python
# BEFORE
learning_rate: 1e-3  # Too high for transformers

# AFTER
schedule = optax.warmup_cosine_decay_schedule(
    init_value=0.0,
    peak_value=1e-4,     # 10x lower
    warmup_steps=1000,   # Gradual warmup
    decay_steps=10000,
    end_value=1e-6
)
optimizer = optax.adamw(learning_rate=schedule, weight_decay=0.01)
```

**Expected Impact**: More stable convergence, avoid oscillations

---

**Solution 4: Architecture Simplification (If Above Fails)**
```python
# Hypothesis: Transformer decoder too complex for small data
# Solution: Simplify to CNN decoder (U-Net style)

# BEFORE: CNN encoder + Transformer decoder
encoder = CNNEncoder(...)        # Good
decoder = TransformerDecoder(...)  # Problematic (needs too much data)

# AFTER: Full U-Net (proven architecture)
model = UNet(
    encoder_depths=[64, 128, 256, 512],
    decoder_depths=[256, 128, 64, 32],
    skip_connections=True  # Critical for segmentation
)
```

**Expected Impact**: Match U-Net baseline (0.75 Dice)

---

#### Iterative Debugging Results

**Iteration 1: Dice Loss + Lower LR**
```python
# Changes: Dice loss, LR 1e-3 → 1e-4
Epoch 10: loss=0.45, val_dice=0.42 (+0.30 improvement!)
Epoch 30: loss=0.35, val_dice=0.58 (+0.46 improvement!)
Epoch 50: loss=0.30, val_dice=0.63 (+0.51 improvement!)
```
**Outcome**: Major improvement! Dice 0.12 → 0.63 (hypothesis 1 confirmed)

---

**Iteration 2: Add Augmentation**
```python
# Changes: Aggressive augmentation (elastic, mixup)
Epoch 50: loss=0.28, val_dice=0.68 (+0.05 improvement)
Epoch 80: loss=0.25, val_dice=0.71 (+0.08 improvement)
```
**Outcome**: Further improvement to 0.71 Dice (hypothesis 2 confirmed)

---

**Iteration 3: Simplify to U-Net (Ablation)**
```python
# Replace Transformer decoder with CNN decoder
Epoch 50: loss=0.22, val_dice=0.75 (+0.04 improvement)
```
**Outcome**: Matches U-Net baseline! Transformer decoder was overfitting small dataset.

---

#### Step 5: Validation & Final Recommendations

**Q1: Root causes identified?**
1. ✅ **Class imbalance + BCE loss**: Switching to Dice loss fixed core issue (+0.51 Dice)
2. ✅ **Insufficient data for transformer**: Transformer decoder underperformed CNN decoder on small dataset
3. ✅ **Learning rate too high**: Reducing LR contributed to stability

**Q2: Final architecture recommendation?**
```python
# Recommended: U-Net with Dice loss (0.75 Dice)
# Rationale: Proven architecture, appropriate for small datasets

# If hybrid CNN-Transformer desired:
# - Pre-train on larger dataset first
# - Use lighter transformer (2 layers, not 6)
# - Aggressive augmentation
# - Expected: 0.73 Dice (slightly worse than full U-Net)
```

**Q3: Deployment decision?**
- **Current**: 0.75 Dice with U-Net
- **Target**: 0.70+ Dice for clinical use
- **Decision**: ✅ **Ready for deployment**
- **Continuous improvement**: Collect more data (500 → 2000 images) to enable transformer architectures
