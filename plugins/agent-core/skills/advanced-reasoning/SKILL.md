# Advanced Reasoning & Meta-Cognition

Expert guide for maximizing LLM cognitive performance through systematic reasoning and self-correction.

## 1. Reasoning Frameworks

- **First Principles**: Deconstruct problems into fundamental truths and rebuild solutions from the ground up.
- **Systems Thinking**: Analyze complex interdependencies and feedback loops within a system.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Use the "Five Whys" and Fishbone diagrams to identify underlying issues.
- **OODA Loop**: Rapidly observe, orient, decide, and act in dynamic environments.

## 2. Thought Structuring

- **Explicit Chains**: Document the step-by-step logic used to reach a conclusion.
- **Branching**: Explore multiple potential solutions concurrently before committing to a path.
- **Evidence-Based**: Support every major claim with data, logs, or established facts.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assign honest confidence levels to conclusions to highlight uncertainty.

## 3. Meta-Cognitive Reflection

- **Self-Correction**: Periodically review the reasoning chain for contradictions or invalid assumptions.
- **Bias Detection**: Actively search for and mitigate common cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias).
- **Session Reflection**: Analyze the entire problem-solving session to improve future reasoning strategies.

## 4. Reasoning Checklist

- [ ] **Assumptions**: Are all assumptions made explicit and validated?
- [ ] **Branches**: Have alternative interpretations or solutions been considered?
- [ ] **Contradictions**: Has the reasoning chain been checked for internal consistency?
- [ ] **Auditability**: Can a human follow the logic from the problem statement to the final decision?
