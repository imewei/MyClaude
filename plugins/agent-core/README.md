# Agent Core Suite

Consolidated suite for multi-agent coordination, deep reasoning, and specialized LLM application development. Optimized for Claude Code v2.1.12 with parallel agent execution and MCP server integration.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Expert coordination of specialized agent teams and complex distributed workflows.
- **Advanced Reasoning**: Systematic problem-solving using structured frameworks, meta-cognitive reflection, and Chain-of-Thought.
- **Context Engineering**: Intelligent management of long-running session context, vector databases, and knowledge graphs.
- **LLM Application Patterns**: Production-ready RAG implementation, prompt optimization, and evaluation frameworks.
- **MCP Integration**: First-class support for Model Context Protocol servers (Serena, GitHub, Context7).
