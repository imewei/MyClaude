# Frontend & Mobile Engineering

Expert guide for creating high-quality user interfaces across all platforms.

## 1. Multi-Platform Strategy

- **Flutter**: High code sharing (90%+), consistent UI across platforms, native performance.
- **React Native**: Leverages JS/TypeScript ecosystem, good for web/mobile synergy.
- **KMP (Kotlin Multiplatform)**: Share business logic while keeping native UIs.

## 2. Modern Web Patterns

- **Framework Mastery**: Expert use of React (hooks, server components), Vue, or Angular.
- **State Management**: Use Redux, MobX, or Context API for complex application state.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries.

## 3. Mobile Development Best Practices

- **Offline-First**: Implement local caching (SQLite, Hive) and background synchronization.
- **UX/UI**: Follow Material Design (Android) and Human Interface Guidelines (iOS).
- **Performance**: Optimize image assets, minimize bridge crossings (RN), and ensure 60 FPS animations.

## 4. Engineering Checklist

- [ ] **Code Reuse**: Is business logic separated from the UI to maximize sharing?
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Does the app meet WCAG standards? Are screen readers supported?
- [ ] **Responsive**: Does the UI adapt to different screen sizes and orientations?
- [ ] **Performance**: Are bundles minimized? Is the critical rendering path optimized?
- [ ] **Testing**: Are unit and E2E (Cypress, Maestro) tests implemented for critical flows?
