# Language Mastery

Comprehensive guide for writing idiomatic, high-performance code in the industry's most critical languages.

## 1. Python (Scientific & Backend)
- **AsyncIO**: Master the event loop, `async/await`, and non-blocking I/O.
- **Packaging**: Use modern tools like `uv`, `poetry`, or `ruff`.
- **Performance**: Use Numba or Cython for numerical bottlenecks.

## 2. JavaScript & TypeScript
- **TypeScript**: Master advanced types (generics, mapped types, conditional types) for type-safe applications.
- **Node.js**: Optimize backend performance with non-blocking patterns and worker threads.
- **Modern ES**: Leverage the latest ECMAScript features (destructuring, async generators, etc.).

## 3. Systems Programming (Rust/Go/C++)
- **Rust**: Master ownership, borrowing, and the trait system for memory-safe systems.
- **Go**: Use goroutines and channels for high-concurrency network services.
- **C++**: Leverage RAII, smart pointers, and template metaprogramming.

## 4. Engineering Checklist
- [ ] **Idiomatic Code**: Does the code follow language-specific best practices (e.g., PEP 8)?
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Are types used to prevent common runtime errors?
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Are dependencies pinned and audited for security?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Are public APIs documented with docstrings/JSDoc?
