# Software Engineering Suite

Consolidated suite for full-stack engineering, language-specific development, and platform-specific implementations. Optimized for Claude Code v2.1.12 with parallel agent execution and MCP server integration.

## 🚀 Features

- **Full-Stack Orchestration**: End-to-end feature delivery coordinating frontend, backend, and database changes.
- **Systems Engineering**: Low-level programming in Rust, C, C++, and Go with a focus on performance and safety.
- **Modern App Development**: Building high-quality applications for Web (React/Next.js) and Mobile (Flutter/React Native).
- **Backend Architecture**: Scalable microservices, high-performance APIs (REST/GraphQL/gRPC), and database optimization.
- **Legacy Modernization**: Systematic migration of legacy codebases using proven patterns like Strangler Fig.
- **Developer Tools**: Production-grade CLI tool design and workflow automation.
