# Comprehensive Double-Check & Validation

**Systematic multi-dimensional validation with automated verification, security analysis, and ultrathink reasoning**

## Your Task: $ARGUMENTS

## Validation Framework

Execute a comprehensive validation across **10 critical dimensions**:

---

### 1. Scope & Requirements Verification

**First, understand what was supposed to be done:**

1. **Extract Original Requirements**
   - Review conversation history for the original task
   - List all explicit requirements
   - Identify implicit expectations
   - Note any constraints or limitations mentioned

2. **Define "Complete" for This Task**
   - Functional requirements met?
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, UX)?
   - Documentation requirements?
   - Testing requirements?

3. **Requirement Traceability**
   - [ ] Every requirement has been addressed
   - [ ] No requirements were misinterpreted
   - [ ] No scope creep introduced unintended features
   - [ ] All acceptance criteria satisfied

---

### 2. Functional Correctness Analysis

**Does it actually work as intended?**

   - Validate API contracts and interfaces

2. **Edge Case Coverage**
   - Empty inputs (null, undefined, empty strings, empty arrays)
   - Boundary values (min, max, zero, negative)
   - Invalid inputs (wrong types, malformed data)
   - Extreme scale (very large inputs, many concurrent requests)
   - Race conditions and timing issues

3. **Error Handling Robustness**
   - All error paths identified and handled
   - Error messages are clear and actionable
   - Graceful degradation when dependencies fail
   - No silent failures or swallowed exceptions

4. **Automated Testing**
   ```bash
   # Run existing tests
   npm test || pytest || cargo test || go test ./...

   # Check test coverage
