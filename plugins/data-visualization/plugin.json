  "description": "Comprehensive data visualization and UI design for scientific computing with Python/Julia ecosystems. Expert-level agent and skills for publication-quality figures, interactive dashboards, accessibility-first design, and immersive AR/VR interfaces. v1.0.1 features enhanced agent with systematic frameworks and optimized skills for better discoverability.",
  "changelog": "v1.0.1: Enhanced visualization-interface agent with triggering criteria (20 USE cases, 8 anti-patterns with decision tree), 6-step chain-of-thought reasoning framework (60 guiding questions), 5 Constitutional AI principles (50 self-check questions), and comprehensive Climate Change Dashboard example (730+ lines). Agent growth: 399 → 1,182 lines (783 lines added, 296% growth), maturity 91%. Enhanced all 3 skills with detailed descriptions for better Claude Code discoverability, comprehensive 'When to use this skill' sections with 20-27 specific use cases each, and explicit file type triggers (.py, .jl, .ipynb, app.py). Expected: 50-70% better visualization quality, 60% faster development, 70% more thorough design analysis, significantly improved skill discovery and proactive usage.",
