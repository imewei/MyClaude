## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

**No breaking changes** - v2.0.0 is fully backward compatible with v1.0.0.

**New features are opt-in**:
- Adaptive routing works automatically
- Caching activates automatically
- Monitoring tracks metrics transparently
- Reference materials available but optional

**Recommended actions after upgrade**:
1. Review new reference materials in skills
2. Explore visual diagrams for deeper understanding
3. Check anti-patterns catalog to improve existing code
4. Run validation scripts to ensure plugin health
5. Monitor performance metrics to track improvements

**No code changes required** - existing workflows continue to work as before.
