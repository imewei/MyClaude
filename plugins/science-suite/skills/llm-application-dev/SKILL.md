# LLM Application Development

Building robust applications with Large Language Models.

## Expert Agents

For LLM application development, delegate to:

- **`ai-engineer`**: RAG systems, agentic workflows, and application architecture.
  - *Location*: `plugins/science-suite/agents/ai-engineer.md`
- **`prompt-engineer`**: Prompt optimization, safety, and evaluation.
  - *Location*: `plugins/science-suite/agents/prompt-engineer.md`

## Core Skills

### [RAG Implementation](./rag-implementation/SKILL.md)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation architectures and vector database integration.

### [Prompt Engineering Patterns](./prompt-engineering-patterns/SKILL.md)
Advanced prompting techniques including Chain-of-Thought and few-shot learning.

### [LangChain Architecture](./langchain-architecture/SKILL.md)
Building chains, agents, and custom tools with LangChain.

### [LLM Evaluation](./llm-evaluation/SKILL.md)
Evaluating model performance, hallucination rates, and answer quality.
