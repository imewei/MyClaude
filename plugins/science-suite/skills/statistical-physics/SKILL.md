# Statistical Physics

Master the theoretical and computational tools of statistical mechanics.

## Expert Agent

For complex statistical mechanics problems, active matter simulations, and theoretical derivations, delegate to the expert agent:

- **`statistical-physicist`**: Unified specialist for Statistical Physics and Soft Matter.
  - *Location*: `plugins/science-suite/agents/statistical-physicist.md`
