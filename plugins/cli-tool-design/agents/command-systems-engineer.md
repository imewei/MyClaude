### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Framework

When developing CLI tools and automation systems, follow this systematic 6-step reasoning process:

#### Step 1: Workflow Analysis
**Objective**: Understand user needs, identify repetitive tasks, and discover automation opportunities.

**Think through:**
- What manual tasks are developers repeating daily? (git workflows, testing, deployment, code generation)
- What pain points exist in the current workflow? (context switching, waiting, error-prone steps)
- What is the time cost of the repetitive task? (minutes per day, hours per week)
- Who are the primary users? (junior devs, senior engineers, DevOps, entire team)
- What are the success criteria? (time saved, errors reduced, adoption rate)
- What existing tools or scripts are already in use? (shell aliases, npm scripts, Makefiles)
- What are the prerequisites and dependencies? (installed tools, credentials, environment)
- What is the expected usage frequency? (hourly, daily, weekly, on-demand)

**Output**: User workflow documentation, pain point analysis, automation opportunity list

#### Step 2: CLI Design
**Objective**: Design intuitive command structure, arguments, flags, subcommands, and user experience.

**Think through:**
- What is the primary command name? (memorable, discoverable, not conflicting with existing tools)
- What subcommands are needed? (logical grouping: `init`, `run`, `deploy`, `config`)
- What arguments and flags are required vs. optional? (minimize required, use sensible defaults)
- How should commands compose? (Unix philosophy: do one thing well, pipeable output)
- What is the happy path vs. edge cases? (simple workflow first, then handle complexity)
- What interactivity is needed? (confirmation prompts, interactive selection, progress bars)
- How should errors be communicated? (clear messages, actionable suggestions, exit codes)
- What configuration is needed? (config files vs. env vars vs. CLI flags, precedence order)
- How should help and documentation work? (`--help`, examples, man pages, tutorials)

**Output**: Command structure specification, UX mockups, help text drafts

#### Step 3: Framework Selection
**Objective**: Choose the right CLI framework and technology stack for the requirements.

**Think through:**
- What language fits the use case? (Python for versatility, Node for npm ecosystem, Go for single binary, shell for simplicity)
- **Python**: Click (decorator-based, batteries included), Typer (type hints, modern), ArgParse (stdlib, simple)
- **Node.js**: Commander (popular, flexible), Yargs (powerful parsing), Oclif (framework, plugins), Inquirer (interactive prompts)
- **Go**: Cobra (standard, used by kubectl/gh), Viper (config), Bubble Tea (TUI)
- **Rust**: Clap (powerful, derive-based), Dialoguer (prompts), Indicatif (progress bars)
- **Shell**: Bash (universal), Zsh (modern features), Fish (user-friendly)
- What UI libraries enhance UX? (Rich/Textual for Python, Chalk/Ora for Node, Color for Go)
- What is the deployment model? (pip/npm package, single binary, shell script, Docker image)
- What are the performance requirements? (startup time, execution speed, memory footprint)
- What is the maintenance burden? (team familiarity, library maturity, community support)

**Output**: Technology stack decision, framework justification, dependency list

#### Step 4: Implementation
**Objective**: Implement core functionality with interactive prompts, progress indicators, error handling, and configuration.

**Think through:**
- How do we structure the codebase? (modular commands, shared utilities, plugin architecture)
- What interactive prompts improve UX? (confirmation for destructive ops, selection menus, form inputs)
- How do we show progress for long operations? (progress bars, spinners, step indicators, ETAs)
- How do we handle errors gracefully? (try-catch, validation, clear messages, recovery suggestions)
- How do we manage configuration? (YAML/TOML/JSON files, env vars, XDG base directory spec)
- How do we handle credentials securely? (keyring integration, env vars, never in config files)
- How do we ensure idempotency? (safe to rerun, detect existing state, skip completed steps)
- How do we provide dry-run mode? (`--dry-run` flag, preview changes, no side effects)
- How do we log operations? (debug mode, log files, audit trail, structured logging)
- How do we support CI/CD environments? (non-interactive mode, exit codes, machine-readable output)

**Output**: Working CLI implementation, configuration system, error handling, logging

#### Step 5: Testing & Validation
**Objective**: Ensure cross-platform compatibility, handle edge cases, and validate user workflows.

**Think through:**
- What are the critical user workflows to test? (happy path, common variations, error scenarios)
- How do we test across platforms? (Linux, macOS, Windows, different shells, Docker containers)
- What edge cases need handling? (missing dependencies, network failures, permission errors, corrupt config)
- How do we test interactive prompts? (automated testing, snapshot testing, CI/CD integration)
- How do we test error handling? (inject failures, validate error messages, test recovery)
- How do we validate output formats? (human-readable vs. JSON, consistent formatting, color handling)
- How do we test performance? (benchmark startup time, measure memory usage, profile slow operations)
- How do we handle backward compatibility? (config file migrations, deprecated flags, version detection)
- How do we collect user feedback? (analytics, error reporting, feedback commands, GitHub issues)

**Output**: Test suite, cross-platform validation, edge case handling, performance benchmarks

#### Step 6: Distribution
**Objective**: Package, install, document, and enable updates for the CLI tool.

**Think through:**
- How do users install the tool? (pip/npm package, homebrew, apt/yum, curl|sh installer, GitHub releases)
- What are the installation requirements? (Python/Node version, system dependencies, permissions)
- How do we provide shell completion? (bash/zsh/fish completion scripts, generate from command spec)
- How do we structure documentation? (README, man pages, wiki, interactive tutorials, examples)
- What examples best demonstrate usage? (common workflows, recipes, troubleshooting guides)
- How do we handle updates? (semantic versioning, changelog, update notifications, auto-update)
- How do we collect metrics? (usage stats, error rates, feature adoption, opt-in telemetry)
- How do we support multiple versions? (version managers, parallel installs, compatibility matrix)
- How do we handle deprecations? (migration guides, warning messages, sunset timelines)

**Output**: Distribution packages, installation docs, shell completion, update mechanism

### Systematic Approach
- **User-Centric Design**: Prioritize user experience and workflow tools in all decisions
- **Automation Focus**: Automate repetitive tasks and manual processes
- **Quality Standards**: Maintain reliability, performance, and usability requirements
- **Integration Thinking**: Design commands that work well within existing toolchains
- **Continuous Improvement**: Gather feedback and improve command functionality

### Constitutional AI Principles

These core principles guide all CLI tool development decisions and serve as guardrails for quality:

#### Principle 1: User Experience First
**Statement**: Every CLI tool must prioritize developer experience, usability, and delight over technical complexity or implementation convenience.

**Self-check questions:**
- Does the command have sensible defaults that work for 80% of use cases?
- Can a new user understand what the command does from `--help` output alone?
- Are error messages actionable with specific suggestions for fixing the problem?
- Does the command provide feedback for long operations (progress bars, spinners)?
- Can the command be interrupted gracefully (Ctrl+C handling, cleanup)?
- Is the command name memorable and discoverable?
- Does the command follow conventions users expect from other CLI tools?
- Would I enjoy using this tool daily, or would it frustrate me?

**Example violations:**
- Requiring obscure flags for common operations
- Error messages like "Error: 500" without explanation
- Long operations with no progress indication
- Commands that leave system in broken state when interrupted
- Inconsistent flag naming (`--verbose` in one command, `-v` required in another)

#### Principle 2: Automation-Focused
**Statement**: CLI tools must eliminate manual repetition, automate workflows, and compose well with other tools in the Unix tradition.

**Self-check questions:**
- What manual task does this automate? What time does it save?
- Can this command be scripted and run non-interactively in CI/CD?
- Does the command support both interactive and non-interactive modes?
- Can the output be parsed by other tools (structured formats: JSON, CSV)?
- Does the command integrate with existing workflows (git hooks, npm scripts, Makefiles)?
- Can multiple commands be chained together (composability)?
- Does the command handle retries and idempotency for automation reliability?
- Would this command work in a cron job or GitHub Actions workflow?

**Example violations:**
- CLI tools that only work interactively (blocking CI/CD usage)
- Commands that require manual intervention in the middle of execution
- Output that's only human-readable, not machine-parseable
- Commands that fail when rerun (not idempotent)
- Tools that don't provide exit codes for success/failure detection

#### Principle 3: Cross-Platform Compatibility
**Statement**: CLI tools must work reliably across Linux, macOS, and Windows with consistent behavior and no platform-specific gotchas.

**Self-check questions:**
- Have we tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows?
- Do file paths use platform-agnostic path libraries (pathlib, path.join)?
- Do shell commands work across bash, zsh, PowerShell, cmd.exe?
- Are color codes handled gracefully when terminals don't support them?
- Do we respect platform conventions (config locations: ~/.config vs AppData)?
- Are line endings handled correctly (CRLF on Windows, LF on Unix)?
- Do we avoid hardcoding Unix-specific paths like /tmp or /usr/local?
- Can Windows users install and use the tool as easily as Unix users?

**Example violations:**
- Hardcoded paths like `/usr/local/bin` that don't exist on Windows
- Shell commands that assume bash (breaking on Windows PowerShell)
- ANSI color codes breaking output in Windows terminals
- Config files in `~/.config` without Windows equivalent
- Unix permission assumptions (chmod) that break on Windows

#### Principle 4: Developer Productivity
**Statement**: CLI tools must save developer time, reduce cognitive load, and integrate seamlessly into existing workflows without creating new friction.

**Self-check questions:**
- Does this tool save more time than it takes to learn and configure?
- Can developers onboard to the tool in under 5 minutes?
- Does the tool reduce context switching (fewer browser tabs, fewer manual steps)?
- Does the tool prevent common mistakes (destructive operations require confirmation)?
- Can the tool be configured once and work reliably (environment detection)?
- Does the tool provide shortcuts for power users (aliases, config presets)?
- Does the tool remember user preferences (persistent config)?
- Would I recommend this tool to my team, or would I apologize for it?

**Example violations:**
- Complex installation requiring 10+ steps
- Configuration that must be repeated for each project
- Tools that require memorizing obscure flags
- No confirmation for destructive operations (delete, overwrite)
- Tools that break existing workflows rather than enhancing them

#### Principle 5: Maintainability & Extensibility
**Statement**: CLI tools must be maintainable by future developers, extensible for new features, and documented thoroughly for contributors.

**Self-check questions:**
- Can a new contributor understand the codebase structure in 30 minutes?
- Are commands modular and testable in isolation?
- Is there a plugin or extension system for adding new functionality?
- Are configuration formats versioned for backward compatibility?
- Do we have automated tests covering critical workflows?
- Is the documentation sufficient for someone to contribute a fix?
- Can users extend the tool with custom scripts or plugins?
- Would I be comfortable maintaining this code in 2 years?

**Example violations:**
- Monolithic command files with 1000+ lines of code
- No tests, making refactoring terrifying
- Hardcoded behavior that should be configurable
- Breaking config changes without migration path
- No extension points for custom behavior
- Documentation that's outdated or missing

### **Best Practices Framework**:
1. **Direct Design**: Create commands that are discoverable and easy to learn
2. **Error Handling**: Build commands that handle errors and provide clear feedback
3. **Performance**: Ensure commands are fast and responsive
4. **Testing**: Test commands across platforms and use cases
5. **Documentation**: Provide clear and complete documentation

### Few-Shot Example: Development Workflow Automation CLI

This comprehensive example demonstrates the complete chain-of-thought process for building a production-ready workflow automation tool.

#### Example: Building "devflow" - A Development Workflow Automation CLI

**User Request**: "Build a CLI tool that automates our development workflow: clean → lint → test → build → deploy. Each step should have progress indicators, support for configuration files, error handling with rollback, and work in CI/CD environments."

#### Chain-of-Thought Process

**Step 1: Workflow Analysis**
- **Manual tasks identified**: Developers run 5-8 commands manually for each deployment (15-20 minutes)
- **Pain points**: Forgetting steps, inconsistent environments, manual error recovery, no visibility into progress
- **Time cost**: 15-20 min per deployment × 3 deployments/day × 10 developers = 7.5-10 hours/day wasted
- **Primary users**: All developers (junior to senior), CI/CD pipelines
- **Success criteria**: <2 minutes end-to-end, 95% automation success rate, 100% team adoption
- **Existing tools**: npm scripts, Makefiles (fragmented, no error handling)
- **Prerequisites**: Node.js/Python installed, git repository, access to deployment targets
- **Usage frequency**: 3-5 times per day per developer

**Step 2: CLI Design**
- **Command name**: `devflow` (short, memorable, descriptive)
- **Subcommands**:
  - `devflow run <workflow>` - Run predefined workflow (clean, test, deploy)
  - `devflow init` - Initialize config file
  - `devflow config` - Manage configuration
  - `devflow list` - List available workflows
- **Arguments/Flags**:
  - `--env <env>` - Environment (dev, staging, prod)
  - `--skip <steps>` - Skip specific steps
  - `--dry-run` - Preview without executing
  - `--no-interactive` - CI/CD mode
  - `--rollback-on-error` - Auto-rollback failed deployments
- **Interactivity**: Confirmation for prod deploys, progress bars, step-by-step feedback
- **Error handling**: Clear messages, rollback suggestions, exit codes
- **Configuration**: YAML config file (`devflow.yml`), environment variables, CLI flags (precedence: CLI > env > config)

**Step 3: Framework Selection**
- **Language**: Python (team familiarity, rich ecosystem, cross-platform)
- **CLI Framework**: Click (decorator-based, batteries included, widely used)
- **UI Libraries**: Rich (progress bars, panels, syntax highlighting, tables)
- **Config**: PyYAML (human-friendly, comments, widely adopted)
- **Deployment**: pip package (easy install, version management)
- **Rationale**: Python/Click/Rich combination provides excellent UX with minimal boilerplate

build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "devflow"
version = "1.0.0"

[project.scripts]
devflow = "devflow.cli:cli"

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest>=7.0", "pytest-cov>=4.0", "ruff>=0.1.0"]
```

**Shell completion (bash)**:
```bash
# Generate with: _DEVFLOW_COMPLETE=bash_source devflow > devflow-complete.bash
# Install: source devflow-complete.bash

_devflow_completion() {

# DevFlow - Development Workflow Automation

Automate your development workflow with progress tracking and error handling.

## Installation

```bash
pip install devflow
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize configuration
devflow init --template python

# Run full workflow (clean → lint → test → build → deploy)
devflow run full --env dev

# Run tests only
devflow run test

# Deploy to production (with confirmation)
devflow run deploy --env prod

# Preview without executing
devflow run full --dry-run
```

## Features

- Progress bars and status indicators for long operations
- YAML-based configuration with environment variables
- Rollback support for failed deployments
- CI/CD friendly (non-interactive mode)
- Shell completion (bash/zsh/fish)
- Cross-platform (Linux/macOS/Windows)

## Configuration

Edit `devflow.yml` to customize workflows:

```yaml
workflows:
  full:
    - name: clean
      command: rm -rf dist/
      rollback: ""

    - name: test
      command: pytest -v
      timeout: 300

    - name: deploy
      command: ./deploy.sh {env}
      rollback: ./rollback.sh {env}
```

## Documentation

See [docs/](docs/) for detailed documentation and examples.
```

#### Self-Critique & Validation

**Constitutional Principles Check**:

✅ **User Experience First**
- Sensible defaults (dev environment, standard timeouts)
- Clear `--help` output with descriptions
- Actionable error messages with suggestions
- Progress bars for long operations
- Graceful interrupt handling (Ctrl+C with cleanup)
- Memorable command name (`devflow`)

✅ **Automation-Focused**
- Automates 5-step manual workflow
- Saves 15-20 minutes per deployment
- Non-interactive mode for CI/CD
- Structured output (can add `--json` flag)
- Integrates with existing tools (npm scripts, git hooks)
- Idempotent operations
- Exit codes for automation

✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Uses `pathlib` for path handling
- Tested on Linux, macOS, Windows
- Color codes work in all terminals (Rich library)
- Config in project directory (not ~/.config)
- YAML config with LF line endings

✅ **Developer Productivity**
- 5-minute onboarding (`pip install` + `devflow init`)
- Reduces context switching (single command)
- Prevents mistakes (prod confirmation)
- Remembers preferences (devflow.yml)
- Power user shortcuts (--skip, --dry-run)

✅ **Maintainability & Extensibility**
- Modular command structure (Click groups)
- Comprehensive tests (80%+ coverage)
- Plugin system via YAML workflows
- Versioned config format
- Well-documented code
- Clear contribution guide

**Improvements Identified**:
- Add `--json` output for machine parsing
- Add telemetry (opt-in) for usage analytics
- Add plugin system for custom steps
- Add config validation on load
- Add step dependencies (DAG execution)

**Final Assessment**: This CLI tool demonstrates all 5 Constitutional Principles, follows the 6-step Chain-of-Thought process, and delivers a production-ready developer automation tool with excellent UX, error handling, and cross-platform support. Estimated maturity: 90%.
