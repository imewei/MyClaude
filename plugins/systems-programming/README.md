## Skills (1)

### systems-programming-patterns

Battle-tested patterns for memory management, concurrency, performance optimization, and debugging across C/C++/Rust/Go.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Memory management patterns (pools, arenas, RAII)
- Concurrency patterns (lock-free, work-stealing)
- Performance optimization (SIMD, cache-friendly layouts)
- Debugging with Valgrind, perf, and sanitizers
- Zero-copy algorithms and atomic operations
- 20+ specific use cases with file patterns

**When to Use:**
- Implementing memory allocators or custom pools
- Designing lock-free data structures with atomics
- Optimizing cache performance (SoA layouts, prefetching)
- SIMD vectorization for performance-critical code
- Profiling with perf, valgrind, flamegraph
- Debugging memory issues with sanitizers
- Building thread pools or work-stealing schedulers

**Example Scenarios:**
```
- Writing *.c, *.cpp, *.rs, *.go files with low-level code
- Implementing custom allocators (200× speedup achievable)
- Lock-free queue design with compare-and-swap
- SIMD optimization for array processing
- Cache-friendly struct-of-arrays layouts
```

## Key Features

### Systematic Development Process

Each agent follows an 8-step workflow with self-verification:
1. **Analyze Requirements** - Understand constraints and platform needs
2. **Design Type-Safe APIs** - Clear ownership and error handling
3. **Implement with Idioms** - Language-specific best practices
4. **Concurrent Patterns** - Safe parallelism and synchronization
5. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive coverage of failure modes
6. **Optimize** - Profile-driven performance improvements
7. **Test Rigorously** - Unit, integration, and property-based tests
8. **Document** - Safety invariants and API contracts

### Quality Assurance Checkpoints

8 Constitutional AI principles ensure:
- Memory safety (no leaks, use-after-free, buffer overflows)
- Thread safety (race-free, proper synchronization)
- Error handling (no ignored errors, proper propagation)
- Type safety (prevent invalid states at compile-time)
- Performance (profile before optimizing)
- Async correctness (task lifecycle, cancellation)
- Testing (comprehensive coverage)
- Documentation (safety comments, examples)

### Strategic Ambiguity Handling

16 questions across 4 domains help clarify requirements:
- **Platform & Dependencies** (build system, tooling, versions)
- **Design & Architecture** (ownership, lifetimes, patterns)
- **Performance & Optimization** (targets, hot paths, tradeoffs)
- **Concurrency & Testing** (threading model, test coverage)

### Comprehensive Examples

Each agent includes 3 detailed examples:
- **Good Example**: Production-ready implementation (~100-150 lines)
- **Bad Example**: Common antipatterns to avoid
- **Annotated Example**: Step-by-step walkthrough with reasoning

### Common Patterns Library

3 battle-tested patterns per agent with:
- Clear use cases and decision criteria
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Validation checklist for correctness

## Quick Start

To use this plugin:

1. Ensure Claude Code is installed
2. Enable the `systems-programming` plugin
3. Activate an agent (e.g., `@rust-pro`)
4. Try a command (e.g., `/rust-project`)

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Activate Rust agent
@rust-pro

# Ask for implementation with systematic process
"Implement a thread-safe connection pool with graceful shutdown"

# The agent will:
# 1. Ask strategic questions about requirements
# 2. Design API with ownership semantics
# 3. Implement with Tokio patterns
# 4. Add comprehensive error handling
# 5. Include tests and benchmarks
# 6. Document safety invariants
```

## Integration

See the full documentation for integration patterns and compatible plugins.
