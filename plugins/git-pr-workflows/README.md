## Skills

### Git & PR Patterns (git-advanced-workflows)

**Status:** active

Master advanced Git workflows including interactive rebasing, cherry-picking, git bisect, worktrees, and reflog for clean history and error recovery.

#### When to Use This Skill

- **Before Creating Pull Requests**: Clean up commits by squashing, reordering, or rewording
- **Cross-Branch Commit Application**: Cherry-pick specific commits across multiple branches
- **Bug Investigation**: Use git bisect to find bug-introducing commits
- **Multi-Feature Development**: Work on multiple features using worktrees
- **Git Mistake Recovery**: Recover from hard resets, deleted branches using reflog
- **Branch Synchronization**: Keep feature branches up-to-date with rebase
- **Hotfix Distribution**: Apply critical fixes to multiple release branches
- **Commit Message Editing**: Reword messages for clarity
- **Atomic Commit Creation**: Split large commits into logical changes
- **Fixup Automation**: Use autosquash workflow for automatic fixup combination
- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicts during rebase operations
- **History Linearization**: Convert messy history into clean linear history
- **Experimental Git Operations**: Create backup branches before risky operations

#### Core Techniques Covered

1. **Interactive Rebase**: Pick, reword, edit, squash, fixup, drop commits
2. **Cherry-Picking**: Apply specific commits across branches
3. **Git Bisect**: Binary search to find bug-introducing commits
4. **Worktrees**: Work on multiple branches simultaneously
5. **Reflog**: Track and recover from Git mistakes

3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   claude plugins list | grep git-pr-workflows
   ```

### Using Code Reviewer Agent

**Activate the agent**:
```
@Code Reviewer
```

**Example tasks**:
- "Review this microservice API for security vulnerabilities and performance issues"
- "Analyze this database migration for potential production impact"
- "Assess this React component for accessibility and performance best practices"
- "Review this Kubernetes deployment configuration for security and reliability"

### Using the /commit Command

**Create a quality commit**:
```
/commit
```

**Quick commit without validation**:
```
/commit --quick
```

**Get split recommendations for large changes**:
```
/commit --split
```

### Using Git Advanced Workflows Skill

The skill is automatically activated when working with:
- Git operations (rebase, cherry-pick, bisect)
- Pull request preparation
- Commit history cleanup
- Branch management
- Git mistake recovery

---

## Integration Patterns

### Code Reviewer + /commit Command

1. Make code changes
2. Use `/commit` to create quality atomic commits
3. Use `@Code Reviewer` to review changes before pushing
4. Use `/pr-enhance` to create comprehensive PR description
5. Submit PR with clean history and thorough documentation

### Git Workflow Integration

1. Use `/git-workflow` to establish branching strategy
2. Use git-advanced-workflows skill for branch management
3. Use `/commit` for consistent commit messages
4. Use `@Code Reviewer` for code quality assurance
5. Use `/pr-enhance` for PR optimization

---

## Best Practices

### Code Review

1. **Apply 6-step framework systematically** for thorough coverage
2. **Use Constitutional AI principles** to enforce quality targets
3. **Prioritize security** (95% target) above all else
4. **Validate production readiness** (90% target) before merge
5. **Check performance implications** (88% target) of all changes

### Commit Practices

1. **Use /commit command** for automated quality validation
2. **Create atomic commits** (one logical change per commit)
3. **Follow conventional format**: `type(scope): description`
4. **Score ‚â•70/100** before committing
5. **Explain WHY in body**, not WHAT (code shows what)

### Git Workflows

1. **Use interactive rebase** to clean local commits before pushing
2. **Cherry-pick carefully** when applying fixes across branches
3. **Create backup branches** before risky operations
4. **Use worktrees** for multi-feature parallel development
5. **Leverage reflog** for mistake recovery (90-day safety net)

## Use Case Examples

### Scenario 1: Preparing Feature Branch for PR

```bash
# 1. Clean up commit history
/commit --split  # Check if commits should be split

# 2. Use git-advanced-workflows skill
git rebase -i main  # Interactive rebase to squash, reorder

# 3. Review changes
@Code Reviewer review my authentication implementation

# 4. Create final commits
/commit  # Create quality commits with validation

# 5. Enhance PR
/pr-enhance  # Generate comprehensive PR description
```

### Scenario 2: Applying Hotfix Across Releases

```bash
# 1. Create fix on main
/commit  # Create quality hotfix commit

# 2. Apply to release branches using git-advanced-workflows
git checkout release/2.0
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

git checkout release/1.9
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# 3. Review each application
@Code Reviewer verify hotfix application
```

### Scenario 3: Finding and Fixing Performance Bug

```bash
# 1. Use git bisect (from git-advanced-workflows skill)
git bisect start HEAD v2.1.0
git bisect run npm test

# 2. Review problematic commit
@Code Reviewer analyze this commit for performance issues

# 3. Create fix with /commit
/commit  # Create validated fix commit
```
