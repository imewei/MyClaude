2. **What are the affected systems?** (API, database, UI, infrastructure, auth, payments)
3. **What is the production risk level?** (low, medium, high, critical)
4. **What are the testing requirements?** (unit, integration, E2E, manual, performance)
5. **What are the security implications?** (data exposure, auth changes, injection risks)
6. **What are the dependencies affected?** (external APIs, databases, services, libraries)

## 📝 Comprehensive Code Review Examples

### Example 1: Security Vulnerability Review - SQL Injection Prevention

**Scenario**: Authentication API endpoint with database query

**Code Under Review**:
```python
# api/auth.py
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']

    # ❌ CRITICAL: SQL Injection vulnerability
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
    result = db.execute(query)

    if result:
        session['user_id'] = result['id']
        return jsonify({'success': True})
    return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401
```

**Chain-of-Thought Review Process**:

**Step 1 - Context Analysis**:
- Change scope: Authentication logic (critical security component)
- Affected systems: API, Database, Session Management
- Production risk: CRITICAL (allows unauthorized access)
- Testing requirements: Security testing, penetration testing
- Security implications: SQL injection, credential exposure
- Dependencies: Database, session store

**Step 2 - Automated Analysis**:
- Static analysis tools: Bandit, CodeQL, Semgrep
- Security scans: OWASP ZAP, SQL injection scanners
- Expected findings: SQL injection vulnerability detected
- Code quality: Low complexity, but critical security flaw

**Step 3 - Manual Logic Review**:
- Business logic: Authentication flow is logical BUT unsafe
- Architecture: Direct SQL execution violates security principles
- Error handling: Insufficient (no input validation, generic errors)
- Testability: Difficult to test securely without mocks
- Technical debt: Complete rewrite needed for security

**Step 4 - Security Assessment**:
- Inputs NOT validated: username/password directly interpolated
- SQL injection: CRITICAL vulnerability via string interpolation
- Authentication: Storing plain-text passwords (assumed)
- Secrets: Password comparison should use hashing
- Rate limiting: Missing (brute force vulnerability)
- Observability: No failed login tracking or alerting

**Step 5 - Performance Review**:
- Query optimization: N/A (security takes precedence)
- Resource management: Database connection not properly managed
- Scalability: Session storage not analyzed (separate concern)

**Step 6 - Feedback Synthesis**:

**🔴 BLOCKING ISSUES (Must Fix Before Merge)**:
1. **CRITICAL SQL Injection Vulnerability**
   - **Issue**: Direct string interpolation allows SQL injection attacks
   - **Attack**: `username = "admin' OR '1'='1"; --"` bypasses authentication
   - **Impact**: Complete database compromise, unauthorized access
   - **Fix**: Use parameterized queries with ORM

2. **Missing Input Validation**
   - **Issue**: No validation of username/password format or length
   - **Impact**: Injection attacks, DoS via large inputs
   - **Fix**: Validate and sanitize all inputs

3. **Likely Plain-Text Password Storage**
   - **Issue**: Direct password comparison suggests no hashing
   - **Impact**: Password exposure if database is compromised
   - **Fix**: Use bcrypt/argon2 password hashing

**Fixed Code**:
```python
# api/auth.py
from flask import request, jsonify, session
from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash
from marshmallow import Schema, fields, validates, ValidationError
import logging

# Input validation schema
class LoginSchema(Schema):
    username = fields.String(required=True, validate=lambda x: len(x) <= 100)
    password = fields.String(required=True, validate=lambda x: len(x) <= 128)

    @validates('username')
    def validate_username(self, value):
        if not value.isalnum():
            raise ValidationError("Username must be alphanumeric")

login_schema = LoginSchema()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
@rate_limit(max_attempts=5, window=300)  # 5 attempts per 5 minutes
def login():
    """
    Authenticate user with secure password verification.

    Security: Parameterized queries, bcrypt password hashing, rate limiting
    """
    try:
        # Input validation
        data = login_schema.load(request.form)
    except ValidationError as err:
        logger.warning(f"Login validation failed: {err.messages}")
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid input'}), 400

    username = data['username']
    password = data['password']

    # ✅ SECURE: Parameterized query with ORM
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()

    if user and check_password_hash(user.password_hash, password):
        session['user_id'] = user.id
        session.regenerate()  # Prevent session fixation

        logger.info(f"Successful login: user_id={user.id}")
        return jsonify({
            'success': True,
            'user': {'id': user.id, 'username': user.username}
        })

    # Generic error message (prevent user enumeration)
    logger.warning(f"Failed login attempt: username={username}")
    return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401
```

**Review Summary**:
- **Security**: 0% → 95% (+95 points)
  - ✅ SQL injection prevented via ORM
  - ✅ Input validation with schema
  - ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
  - ✅ Rate limiting against brute force
  - ✅ Session regeneration against fixation
  - ✅ Security logging and monitoring

- **Production Readiness**: 20% → 90% (+70 points)
  - ✅ Comprehensive error handling
  - ✅ Security event logging
  - ✅ Input validation and sanitization

- **Overall Maturity**: 30% → 92.5% (+62.5 points)

### Example 2: Performance Optimization Review - N+1 Query Problem

**Scenario**: API endpoint returning user posts with comments

**Code Under Review**:
```python
# api/posts.py
@app.route('/api/users/<int:user_id>/posts', methods=['GET'])
def get_user_posts(user_id):
    """Get all posts for a user with comments"""
    user = User.query.get_or_404(user_id)

    posts = Post.query.filter_by(user_id=user_id).all()

    # ❌ N+1 QUERY PROBLEM
    result = []
    for post in posts:
        post_data = {
            'id': post.id,
            'title': post.title,
            'content': post.content,
            'comments': [
                {
                    'id': comment.id,
                    'text': comment.text,
                    'author': comment.author.username  # Additional query per comment
                }
                for comment in post.comments  # Query per post
            ]
        }
        result.append(post_data)

    return jsonify(result)
```

**Chain-of-Thought Review Process**:

**Step 1 - Context Analysis**:
- Change scope: API endpoint performance
- Affected systems: API, Database, potentially frontend rendering
- Production risk: Medium (performance degradation under load)
- Security implications: None direct, but DoS possible
- Performance: N+1 query problem evident

**Step 2 - Automated Analysis**:
- Performance tools: Django Debug Toolbar, SQLAlchemy query logger
- Expected findings: Multiple database queries in loop
- Metrics: Query count scales with data (1 + N posts + M comments)

**Step 3 - Logic Review**:
- Business logic: Correctly retrieves posts and comments
- Architecture: Violates efficient data loading principles
- Performance: O(N*M) database queries (unacceptable)

**Step 4 - Performance Assessment**:
- **Database queries**: For 10 posts with 5 comments each:
  - Current: 1 (user) + 1 (posts) + 10 (comments per post) + 50 (authors) = 62 queries
  - Optimal: 3-4 queries maximum with eager loading
- **Response time**: 620ms (10ms per query × 62) vs optimal 40ms
- **Database load**: 15.5x higher than necessary
- **Scalability**: Doesn't scale (100 posts = 500+ queries)

**Step 5 - Feedback Synthesis**:

**🟠 CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE (Fix Before Production)**:
1. **N+1 Query Problem**
   - **Issue**: Separate database query for each post's comments and each comment's author
   - **Impact**: 15-60x more database queries than necessary
   - **Production risk**: Database connection exhaustion, slow responses, timeouts
   - **Fix**: Use eager loading with joinedload/selectinload

**Fixed Code**:
```python
# api/posts.py
from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload, selectinload
from flask_caching import Cache

cache = Cache(app, config={'CACHE_TYPE': 'redis'})

@app.route('/api/users/<int:user_id>/posts', methods=['GET'])
@cache.cached(timeout=300, query_string=True)  # 5-minute cache
def get_user_posts(user_id):
    """
    Get all posts for a user with comments.

    Performance: Eager loading prevents N+1 queries (3 queries total)
    Caching: 5-minute Redis cache for frequently accessed users
    """
    user = User.query.get_or_404(user_id)

    # ✅ OPTIMIZED: Eager load comments and authors in single query
    posts = (
        Post.query
        .filter_by(user_id=user_id)
        .options(
            selectinload(Post.comments).joinedload(Comment.author)
        )
        .all()
    )

    # Transform to JSON (no additional queries)
    result = [
        {
            'id': post.id,
            'title': post.title,
            'content': post.content,
            'comments': [
                {
                    'id': comment.id,
                    'text': comment.text,
                    'author': comment.author.username  # Already loaded
                }
                for comment in post.comments  # Already loaded
            ]
        }
        for post in posts
    ]

    return jsonify(result)
```

**Performance Benchmarks**:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Database Queries | 62 | 3 | **95% reduction** |
| Response Time | 620ms | 35ms | **94% faster** |

  - ✅ N+1 queries eliminated with eager loading
  - ✅ Redis caching added for hot data
  - ✅ 95% query reduction achieved

- **Scalability**: 30% → 90% (+60 points)
  - ✅ Scales to 900 concurrent users
