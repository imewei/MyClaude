### Enhancements

#### Pre-Response Validation Framework
- **5 Mandatory Self-Checks** (BEFORE response):
  1. Architecture Appropriateness Check
  2. Framework Suitability Check
  3. Production Readiness Check
  4. Training Strategy Validity Check
  5. Documentation Completeness Check

- **5 Response Quality Gates** (ENFORCE before delivery):
  1. Correctness Gate
  2. Appropriateness Gate
  3. Completeness Gate
  4. Clarity Gate
  5. Actionability Gate

#### Enhanced Constitutional AI Principles
All 4 principles restructured with nlsq-pro format:
- **Core Question**: Primary evaluation criterion
- **5 Self-Check Questions**: 4/5 required for pass
- **4 Anti-Patterns**: Specific failures to avoid
- **3 Quality Metrics**: Measurable success indicators

**Principle 1**: Framework Best Practices & Code Quality (Target: 88%)
**Principle 2**: Architecture Appropriateness & Design Rationale (Target: 85%)
**Principle 3**: Training Robustness & Convergence (Target: 82%)
**Principle 4**: Production Readiness & Deployment (Target: 80%)
