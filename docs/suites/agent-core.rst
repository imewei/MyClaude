Hub Skills
----------

Skills use a hub architecture: 3 hub skills route to 14 specialized sub-skills.

Hub: agent-systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multi-agent coordination, performance optimization, evaluation, and tool use patterns.

- ``agent-evaluation`` — Evaluate AI agent performance through systematic testing and benchmarking
- ``agent-performance-optimization`` — Monitor, cache, and load-balance agent systems for production
- ``multi-agent-coordination`` — Workflow orchestration, task allocation, and inter-agent communication
- ``tool-use-patterns`` — Tool selection, chaining, error handling, and result synthesis

Hub: reasoning-and-memory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reasoning frameworks, reflection, knowledge graphs, memory systems, and closed-loop self-improvement.

- ``reasoning-frameworks`` — First Principles, RCA, Decision Analysis, Systems Thinking, OODA Loop
- ``reflection-framework`` — Meta-cognitive analysis, bias detection, and session reflection
- ``knowledge-graph-patterns`` — Knowledge graphs for structured retrieval and semantic reasoning
- ``memory-system-patterns`` — Persistent memory systems with vector stores and context management
- ``self-improving-agents`` — Reflection-refine-validate loops, self-consistency ensembles, DSPy/TextGrad prompt optimization, evolutionary prompt search, constitutional self-critique *(new in v3.1.4)*

Hub: llm-engineering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Intent clarification, prompt engineering, LLM application patterns, MCP integration, and safety.

- ``thinkfirst`` — Interview-first workflow that clarifies vague intent through a Seven Dimensions framework before any prompt is drafted *(new in v3.1.3)*
- ``llm-application-patterns`` — Prompt engineering principles (CoT, few-shot), RAG design, evaluation
- ``mcp-integration`` — MCP server configuration, tool naming conventions, and cross-tool workflows
- ``prompt-engineering-patterns`` — Advanced prompting with chain-of-thought and production templates
- ``safety-guardrails`` — Content filtering, output validation, and responsible AI practices

Hooks
-----

15 hook events with Python script implementations:

- ``SessionStart`` — Session initialization
- ``SessionEnd`` — Session teardown
- ``PreToolUse`` — Before tool execution
- ``PostToolUse`` — After tool execution
- ``PreCompact`` — Before context compaction
- ``PostCompact`` — After context compaction
- ``SubagentStart`` — When a subagent starts
- ``SubagentStop`` — When a subagent completes
- ``PermissionDenied`` — When a tool call is denied
- ``TaskCreated`` — When a task is created
- ``TaskCompleted`` — When a task finishes
- ``StopFailure`` — On agent stop failure
- ``PreSubagentUse`` — Validate subagent dispatch, catch misrouted agents *(new in v3.3.0)*
- ``ExecutionError`` — Structured error capture for reasoning chain failures *(new in v3.3.0)*
- ``PermissionPrompt`` — Log permission dialog events for debugging *(new in v3.3.0)*
