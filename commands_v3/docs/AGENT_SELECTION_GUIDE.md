## Renamed Agents Cheat Sheet

| Old Name | New Name | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| `ai-ml-specialist` | `ml-pipeline-coordinator` | Clearer coordination role |
| `neural-networks` | `neural-architecture-engineer` | Role-based name, not technology |
| `scientific-computing` | `hpc-numerical-coordinator` | More specific, coordinator role |
| `data-professional` | `data-engineering-coordinator` | Clearer focus, coordination role |

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Coordinators Delegate

Coordinator agents (with "coordinator" in the name) route to specialists:
- `ml-pipeline-coordinator` â†’ `jax-pro`, `neural-architecture-engineer`
- `hpc-numerical-coordinator` â†’ `simulation-expert`, `correlation-function-expert`
- `data-engineering-coordinator` â†’ `database-workflow-engineer`, `ml-pipeline-coordinator`

### 2. Specialists Don't Overlap

Each specialist has a specific niche:
- `jax-pro` = JAX programming, not architecture
- `neural-architecture-engineer` = Architecture, not JAX optimization
- `simulation-expert` = Traditional MD, not JAX
- `jax-scientific-domains` = JAX + physics, not general JAX

### 3. When in Doubt

- **Complex task spanning multiple domains** â†’ Start with coordinator agent
- **Very specific technical task** â†’ Start with specialist
- **Unclear boundaries** â†’ Use `multi-agent-orchestrator`
