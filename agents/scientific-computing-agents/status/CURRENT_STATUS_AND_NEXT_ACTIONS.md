## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management

### Top Risks and Mitigation

**Risk 1: Stakeholder Delay in Approval** (Medium Probability, High Impact)
- **Impact**: Delays entire Phase 5 timeline
- **Mitigation**: Present clear, concise plans; emphasize low cost (free tier)
- **Contingency**: Proceed with minimal viable deployment (on-premises or personal GCP account)

**Risk 2: Low User Recruitment Response** (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)
- **Impact**: Fewer than 10 users recruited
- **Mitigation**: Contact 50+ potential users (3:1 conversion ratio)
- **Contingency**: Extend recruitment period to Week 4, lower target to 8 users

**Risk 3: Production Issues During Deployment** (Low Probability, High Impact)
- **Impact**: System unstable, users can't access
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing before deployment, monitoring from Day 1
- **Contingency**: Rollback procedures documented, backup VM available

**Risk 4: Phase 5B Scope Creep** (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)
- **Impact**: Timeline extends beyond 8 weeks
- **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization, defer P2/P3 items if needed
- **Contingency**: Extend by 1-2 weeks or reduce P1 scope

## üìû Questions or Blockers?

### Common Questions

**Q: Why is Phase 5 only 20% complete when infrastructure is done?**
A: Infrastructure (CI/CD, Docker, docs) is necessary but not sufficient. Phase 5 requires:
- Infrastructure (100% done) ‚úÖ
- Execution (deployment, users) - NOT done ‚ùå
- Validation (feedback, metrics) - NOT done ‚ùå
Overall: 20% complete (2 of 10-12 weeks)

**Q: Can we skip Week 3-4 and go directly to Phase 5B?**
A: No. Phase 5B priorities depend on real user feedback from Week 3-4. Without users, we'd be guessing what features matter.

**Q: What if we can't get cloud budget approved?**
A: Options:
1. Use GCP free tier ($300 credit, no charges for 3-6 months)
2. Deploy to on-premises or university infrastructure
3. Use personal cloud account temporarily

**Q: How much time commitment is required?**
A: Week 3: High (full-time deployment and user support)
   Week 4: Medium (analysis and planning)
   Phase 5B: Steady (standard development pace)

**Q: What if users don't respond or engage?**
A: Multiple mitigation strategies:
- Personal outreach (higher conversion than mass emails)
- Multiple channels (academic, online, professional)
- 50+ contacts for 10-15 target (3:1 ratio)
- Can extend recruitment if needed

### Decision Makers

**To approve and proceed, we need**:
- [ ] Executive/stakeholder approval for cloud deployment
- [ ] Budget approval (minimal with free tier)
- [ ] Timeline confirmation (10 weeks commitment)
- [ ] Team assignments (who will execute Week 3-4?)

**Contact**: [Project Lead] to discuss approval and next steps
