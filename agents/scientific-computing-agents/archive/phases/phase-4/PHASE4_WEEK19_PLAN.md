## Open Questions

1. **GPU Priority**: Should GPU acceleration be Week 19 or deferred to later?
   - **Recommendation**: Include if time permits, but not critical path

2. **Profiling Granularity**: Line-level vs function-level profiling?
   - **Recommendation**: Both - function-level by default, line-level on demand

3. **Parallel Strategy**: Threads vs processes vs async?
   - **Recommendation**: All three - let user choose based on workload

4. **Benchmark Storage**: Where to store performance baselines?
   - **Recommendation**: JSON files in `tests/benchmarks/baselines/`
