- ✅ CI/CD pipeline operational
- ✅ Docker containers built and tested
- ✅ Monitoring configured (Prometheus + Grafana)
- ✅ Operations runbook complete
- ✅ User onboarding documentation ready
- ✅ Deployment checklist prepared

**Final Verification** (Day 0 - Execute immediately before Week 3):
```bash
# 1. Verify all tests pass
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
# Expected: 370+ of 379 tests pass (97.6%+)

# 2. Run health check
python scripts/health_check.py
# Expected: All 5 checks pass

# 3. Run security audit
python scripts/security_audit.py
# Expected: No critical issues

## Cloud Provider Selection

### Recommendation: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

**Rationale**:
1. **Scientific Computing Optimized**: Best Python/NumPy/SciPy support
2. **Cost Effective**: $300 free credit for new accounts (3-6 months free)
3. **Container Support**: Excellent Docker/Kubernetes integration
4. **Monitoring**: Native Prometheus/Grafana support
5. **Scalability**: Easy to scale from single VM to cluster

**Alternative Options**:

| Provider | Pros | Cons | Cost/Month | Recommendation |
|----------|------|------|------------|----------------|
| **GCP** | Best scientific support, $300 credit | Learning curve | $0-50 (free tier) | ✅ **Primary** |
| **AWS** | Most features, mature | Complex, expensive | $50-100 | ⚠️ Alternative |
| **Azure** | Good Windows support | Less Python-optimized | $50-80 | ⚠️ Alternative |
| **Heroku** | Simple deployment | Limited resources | $25-50 | ❌ Not suitable |
| **DigitalOcean** | Simple, cheap | Basic features | $20-40 | ⚠️ Budget option |
| **University** | Free, full control | Maintenance burden | $0 | ✅ If available |

**Final Decision**: **GCP** (or university infrastructure if available and suitable)
