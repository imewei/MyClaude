```
Priority Score = (Impact √ó User Demand √ó Urgency) / Effort

Where:
- Impact: 1-10 (user value/business value)
- User Demand: 1-10 (number of users requesting √∑ total users √ó 10)
- Urgency: 1-3 (1=can wait, 2=important, 3=critical)
- Effort: 1-10 (1=1 day, 10=10+ days)
```

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Scope Creep** (High probability, Medium impact)
   - **Mitigation**: Strict prioritization, "no" to new requests mid-phase
   - **Contingency**: P2 items can be deferred

2. **Technical Complexity** (Medium probability, High impact)
   - **Mitigation**: Early technical design, proof of concepts
   - **Contingency**: Simplify approach or defer to Phase 6

3. **User Availability** (Medium probability, Low impact)
   - **Mitigation**: Keep beta users engaged with updates
   - **Contingency**: Recruit additional users if needed

4. **Performance Regressions** (Low probability, High impact)
   - **Mitigation**: Benchmark before/after, continuous monitoring
   - **Contingency**: Rollback capability, performance-focused week

### Contingency Plans

**If behind schedule**:
- Move P2 items to Phase 6
- Extend Week 12 by 1 week
- Reduce scope of P1 items (MVP approach)

**If major blocker encountered**:
- Pivot to alternative approach
- Defer blocked item to Phase 6
- Focus on unblocked items
