# Project History Archive

**Status**: Historical record of project development (Phases 0-5)
**Purpose**: Preserve complete project history for future reference

---

## Overview

This archive contains the complete historical record of the Scientific Computing Agents project development from inception through Phase 5A (82% completion). All content here is **historical** and **read-only** – it documents what was done, what was planned, and what was cancelled.

## Phases

Development organized across 6 phases (Phase 0-5):

### Phase 0: Foundation
- Base classes and infrastructure
- Numerical kernels
- Testing framework

### Phase 1: Numerical Methods (5 agents)
- Location: `phases/phase-1/`
- ODE/PDE Solver, Linear Algebra, Optimization, Integration, Special Functions
- Status: ✅ 100% complete

### Phase 2: Data-Driven Methods (4 agents)
- Location: `phases/phase-2/`
- Physics-Informed ML, Surrogate Modeling, Inverse Problems, Uncertainty Quantification
- Status: ✅ 100% complete

### Phase 3: Support Agents (3 agents)
- Location: `phases/phase-3/`
- Problem Analyzer, Algorithm Selector, Executor Validator
- Status: ✅ 100% complete

### Phase 4: Integration & Performance (2 agents)
- Location: `phases/phase-4/`
- Performance Profiler, Workflow Orchestration
- Status: ✅ 100% complete

### Phase 5: Production Deployment
- Location: `phases/phase-5/`
- **Infrastructure** (Weeks 1-2): ✅ 100% complete - CI/CD, Docker, Monitoring
- **Cancelled** (Weeks 3-4 + Phase 5B): ❌ Not executed - User validation and expansion

## Improvement Plans

Location: `improvement-plans/`

These are **detailed execution plans** for completing the remaining 18% of the project (Phase 5A Weeks 3-4 + Phase 5B). They were **not executed** due to project cancellation but are preserved for future developers.

### Key Plans

**IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_82_TO_100_PERCENT.md** (9,000+ lines)
- Complete roadmap from 82% to 100%
- Parallel accelerated approach
- 6-8 week timeline
- Day-by-day execution plans
- Cost: $0-150 total

**Why These Weren't Executed**: See [PHASE5_CANCELLATION_DECISION.md](phases/phase-5/cancelled/PHASE5_CANCELLATION_DECISION.md)

## For Future Developers

### Want to Complete the Project?

1. **Start here**: `improvement-plans/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_82_TO_100_PERCENT.md`
2. **Understand why cancelled**: `phases/phase-5/cancelled/PHASE5_CANCELLATION_DECISION.md`
3. **See what's needed**:
   - Time: ~165 hours (~1 month FTE, 8 weeks calendar)
   - Budget: $0-50/month (GCP free tier)
   - Personnel: 1 developer (optimal: +1 support)

4. **Execute**:
   - Week 3-4: Deploy + recruit 10-15 users
   - Week 5-10: Implement user-driven features
   - Week 11-12: Release v0.2.0

**Feasibility**: HIGH (all infrastructure ready, all plans documented)
