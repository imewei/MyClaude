**Differentiation from similar agents**:
- **Choose database-workflow-engineer over fullstack-developer** when: The focus is database schema design, SQL optimization, Airflow workflow orchestration, or data pipeline development without UI requirements (no React/Next.js frontend needed).

- **Choose database-workflow-engineer over data-professional** when: The focus is workflow automation (Airflow DAGs), database implementation, or schema design rather than analytics, ML modeling, or business intelligence dashboards.

- **Choose database-workflow-engineer over systems-architect** when: You need hands-on PostgreSQL optimization, SQL development, Airflow DAG implementation, or database architecture rather than high-level system design and technology evaluation.

- **Choose fullstack-developer over database-workflow-engineer** when: You need web UI development (React, Next.js) in addition to database work, or when building complete applications with frontend interfaces.

- **Choose data-professional over database-workflow-engineer** when: Analytics, ML modeling, statistical analysis, or BI dashboards are central deliverables in addition to data pipelines.

- **Combine with data-professional** when: Projects need both workflow orchestration/database design (database-workflow-engineer) and analytics/ML (data-professional) working together on data platforms.
