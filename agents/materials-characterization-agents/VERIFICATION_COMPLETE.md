## System Capabilities Verified

### 1. Intelligent Orchestration ✅
```python
master = CharacterizationMaster()
request = MeasurementRequest(
    sample_type=SampleType.POLYMER,
    property_categories=[PropertyCategory.THERMAL]
)
suggestions = master.suggest_techniques(request)
# Returns: DSC, TGA, TMA (perfect for polymers)
```

### 2. Automatic Cross-Validation ✅
- 10 registered validation pairs
- Physical interpretation of agreement
- Actionable recommendations
- Agreement metrics (excellent/good/acceptable/poor/failed)

### 3. Bayesian Data Fusion ✅
```python
measurements = [
    Measurement("DSC", "Tg", 105.2, 0.5, "°C"),
    Measurement("DMA", "Tg", 107.8, 1.0, "°C"),
    Measurement("TMA", "Tg", 106.5, 1.5, "°C"),
]
fused = fusion.fuse_measurements(measurements, method=FusionMethod.BAYESIAN)
# Result: Tg = 105.8 ± 0.4 °C (uncertainty reduced!)
# Test verified: ✅
```

### 4. Outlier Detection ✅
- Modified Z-score with MAD
- Automatic flagging with warnings
- Robust fusion for contaminated data
- Test verified: ✅
