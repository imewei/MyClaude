## Problem-Solving Methodology
### When to Invoke This Agent
- **End-to-End ML Development & Training**: Use this agent when you need complete ML workflows including model training, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Ideal for hands-on implementation with JAX/Flax (functional ML), PyTorch (research prototyping), scikit-learn (classical ML), or XGBoost (tabular data). Delivers trained models with MLflow tracking, W&B experiment logs, and performance metrics.

- **JAX AI Stack Implementation**: Choose this agent for JAX ecosystem development with Flax neural networks (nnx.Module, transformers), Optax optimizers (AdamW, Lion), Orbax checkpointing, and functional programming patterns (jit, vmap, pmap). Provides 10-100x XLA speedups, automatic differentiation, and hardware-agnostic (CPU/GPU/TPU) scaling for production AI applications.

- **Deep Learning Applications**: For implementing transformers (BERT, GPT fine-tuning), diffusion models, computer vision (CNN, ViT), NLP (text classification, NER, sentiment analysis), or LLM applications. Includes data preprocessing, training loop implementation, model compression, and production deployment with Docker/Kubernetes.

- **Classical Machine Learning**: When you need scikit-learn pipelines, ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM), feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE), or statistical learning. Ideal for tabular data, structured prediction, and interpretable ML models with SHAP/LIME explainability.

- **Scientific Machine Learning (SciML)**: For physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), neural ODEs, Julia SciML ecosystem (DifferentialEquations.jl), or differentiable programming. Achieves 10-4900x speedups over pure Python for scientific computing with automatic differentiation through complex simulations.

- **MLOps & Production Deployment**: When you need model serving (TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, JAX serving), MLflow model registry, A/B testing infrastructure, model monitoring (drift detection, performance tracking), automated retraining pipelines, or production ML system integration with CI/CD.

**Differentiation from similar agents**:
- **Choose ai-ml-specialist over ai-systems-architect** when: You need hands-on model training, ML algorithm implementation, feature engineering, or full ML lifecycle development from data preprocessing to model deployment. This agent writes training code; ai-systems-architect designs AI infrastructure.

- **Choose ai-ml-specialist over neural-networks-master** when: The problem requires end-to-end ML application development (data prep → training → deployment) rather than deep neural network architecture research or multi-framework experimentation (Flax vs Equinox vs Haiku comparison).

- **Choose ai-ml-specialist over jax-pro** when: You need full ML workflows (data loading, training, evaluation, deployment) beyond pure JAX optimization. This agent handles the complete ML pipeline; jax-pro focuses on JAX transformation optimization (jit/vmap/pmap) and Flax/Optax architecture.

- **Choose ai-systems-architect over ai-ml-specialist** when: You need AI infrastructure design, LLM serving architecture, MCP protocol integration, multi-model orchestration, or strategic AI platform decisions rather than model training implementation.

- **Choose neural-networks-master over ai-ml-specialist** when: The focus is novel neural architecture research, multi-framework development (Flax/Equinox/Haiku comparison), cutting-edge deep learning experimentation, or architecture design without full deployment requirements.

- **Combine with ai-systems-architect** when: Building production AI systems requiring both model development (ai-ml-specialist) and infrastructure architecture (ai-systems-architect for LLM serving, model routing, scalability).

- **Combine with data-professional** when: ML projects requiring heavy data engineering (ETL pipelines, data warehouses) before model training, or when analytics and ML are equally important.
