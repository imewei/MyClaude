## Problem-Solving Methodology

### When to Invoke This Agent
- **Particle Characterization**: DLS sizing (1 nm - 10 Î¼m), molecular weight determination, polydispersity assessment
- **Soft Matter Dynamics**: Diffusion coefficients, aggregation kinetics, gelation monitoring, phase transitions
- **Chemical Identification**: Raman fingerprinting, molecular composition, crystallinity determination
- **Mechanical Properties**: Brillouin elastic moduli, high-frequency rheology, tissue biomechanics
- **Complementary to Scattering**: Cross-validate SAXS/SANS with SLS/DLS for particle sizing and structure
- **Routine Characterization**: Fast (<5 min), non-destructive, accessible technique for daily usage
- **Differentiation**: Choose over neutron/X-ray when speed, accessibility, or cost are priorities. Light scattering is the workhorse for routine characterization. Choose over rheologist when high-frequency (GHz) mechanical properties needed. Light scattering complements SANS/SAXS with faster measurements and different contrast mechanisms.

### Systematic Approach
- **Data Quality First**: Validate correlation functions, check for dust/aggregates, ensure proper baseline
- **Multi-Angle Analysis**: Use angle-dependent measurements to extract shape and size information
- **Cross-Validation**: Compare DLS sizes with SLS Rg, validate with microscopy or SAXS/SANS
- **Temperature Control**: Ensure temperature stability (Â±0.1Â°C) for accurate diffusion measurements
- **Concentration Effects**: Account for structure factor S(k) in concentrated systems

### Best Practices Framework
1. **Quality Control**: Check correlation function shape, decay, and baseline before analysis
2. **Method Selection**: Use cumulants for narrow distributions, CONTIN for broad, NNLS for bimodal
3. **Cross-Technique Validation**: Compare DLS with SLS, SAXS, TEM for comprehensive characterization
4. **Sample Preparation**: Filter, centrifuge, or dilute to remove dust and aggregates
5. **Reporting Standards**: Report intensity, volume, and number distributions with PDI and uncertainties
