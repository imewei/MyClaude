## Technical Implementation

### 1. Constrained Optimization (3 methods)

**Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP)**:
- Solves sequence of QP subproblems
- Quadratic convergence near optimum
- Handles equality and inequality constraints
- Implementation via scipy's SLSQP

**Augmented Lagrangian**:
```
L(x,λ,μ,ρ) = f(x) + λ'h(x) + (ρ/2)||h(x)||² + μ'max(0,g(x)) + (ρ/2)||max(0,g(x))||²
```
- Combines penalties and Lagrange multipliers
- Better conditioning than pure penalty methods
- Iteratively increases penalty ρ

**Algorithm**:
1. Minimize augmented Lagrangian (unconstrained)
2. Update multipliers: λ ← λ + ρ*h(x), μ ← max(0, μ + ρ*g(x))
3. Increase penalty: ρ ← ρ * factor
4. Repeat until constraints satisfied

### 2. Global Optimization (3 methods)

**Genetic Algorithm**:
- Population: N individuals (chromosomes)
- Selection: Tournament selection
- Crossover: Single-point (rate 0.8)
- Mutation: Uniform random (rate 0.2)
- Elitism: Best individual always survives

**Simulated Annealing**:
- Acceptance probability: P = exp(-ΔE/T)
- Temperature schedule: T ← α*T (α = 0.9-0.99)
- Metropolis criterion
- Escapes local minima via probabilistic acceptance

**CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy)**:
- Adapts mean μ and covariance C
- Weighted recombination of best λ/2 individuals
- Step-size σ adaptation
- State-of-the-art derivative-free method

### 3. Mixed-Integer Optimization

**Branch-and-Bound**:
```
Algorithm:
1. Solve continuous relaxation
2. If all integer variables are integer → done
3. Find most fractional variable i
4. Branch: x_i ≤ floor(x_i) and x_i ≥ ceil(x_i)
5. Add subproblems to queue
6. Repeat with best lower bound
```

**Key Techniques**:
- Node selection: Best-first (lowest bound)
- Branching: Most fractional variable
- Pruning: Bound > best_integer_solution
- Applications: Discrete control modes, on/off actuators

### 4. Performance Characteristics

**Convergence**:
- **SQP**: Quadratic near optimum (superlinear)
- **Augmented Lagrangian**: Linear (depends on ρ)
- **GA**: O(N*G) evaluations, N = pop size, G = generations
- **SA**: Probabilistic, depends on cooling schedule
- **CMA-ES**: O(λ*N_gen), often best derivative-free
- **Branch-and-bound**: Exponential worst-case, often much better

**Gradient Requirements**:
- SQP: Yes (can use finite differences)
- Augmented Lagrangian: Yes for inner loop
- GA, SA, CMA-ES: No (derivative-free)
- Branch-and-bound: Depends on continuous solver

## Key Insights

**Gradient-Based vs Gradient-Free**:
- Gradient: Fast, local convergence
- Gradient-free: Robust, global search, 10-100x slower

**Constrained vs Unconstrained**:
- Transform constrained → unconstrained via penalties
- SQP efficient for smooth constraints
- Augmented Lagrangian for difficult constraints

**Global vs Local**:
- Local: Fast, may miss global optimum
- Global: Slower, more robust
- Hybrid: Global search → local refinement

**Best Practices**:
- Start with gradient-based if smooth
- Use global methods for multimodal
- CMA-ES best general-purpose derivative-free
- Mixed-integer for discrete decisions
