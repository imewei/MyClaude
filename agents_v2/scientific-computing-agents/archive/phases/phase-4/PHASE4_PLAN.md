## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **GPU Complexity**: May be challenging to integrate GPU support
  - *Mitigation*: Start with simple operations, use existing libraries (JAX, CuPy)

- **FEM Implementation**: Significant complexity
  - *Mitigation*: Start with 1D, leverage existing libraries (FEniCS integration?)

- **Performance Expectations**: May not achieve target speedups
  - *Mitigation*: Profile first, optimize bottlenecks, set realistic targets

### Schedule Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Phase 4 could expand beyond 4 weeks
  - *Mitigation*: Prioritize core deliverables, defer nice-to-haves

- **Documentation Time**: Writing comprehensive docs takes longer than expected
  - *Mitigation*: Start documentation early, write as we implement

### Quality Risks
- **Test Coverage**: New features might reduce overall coverage
  - *Mitigation*: Write tests alongside implementation
