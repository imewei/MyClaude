**Timeline**: 12 weeks
**Effort**: 180-240 hours (2 developers)
**Expected Outcome**: Production system with active users and user-driven feature roadmap

### Alternative Recommendation: **Option A Only**

**If resources are limited**: Deploy to production, gather 2-3 months of feedback, then reassess

**Rationale**:
- Fastest path to user validation
- Lowest resource requirement
- Highest learning value
- Can adjust Phase 6 based on real data
