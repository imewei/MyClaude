## Breakthrough Insights

### Innovation 1: Progressive Disclosure Architecture
The 3-tier structure (active | docs | archive) with README navigation hubs creates a "progressive disclosure" UX pattern that reduces cognitive load while maintaining full access to information.

**Impact**: Users can quickly find what they need without being overwhelmed by historical content.

### Innovation 2: Archive as Feature, Not Afterthought
Treating historical content as a first-class citizen with comprehensive organization and navigation (not just dumping it in an "old/" folder) preserves institutional knowledge while keeping active content clean.

**Impact**: Future developers can understand project evolution and access detailed execution plans.

### Innovation 3: Separation of Concerns at Directory Level
Clear boundaries between:
- **Code** (agents/, core/, tests/) → For developers
- **Documentation** (docs/) → For users
- **Status** (status/) → For stakeholders
- **History** (archive/) → For context

**Impact**: Different audiences can navigate directly to relevant content without confusion.
