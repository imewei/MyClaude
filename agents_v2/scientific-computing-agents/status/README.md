## Decision History

### 2025-10-01: Phase 5A/5B Cancellation

**Decision**: Cancel remaining 18% (Weeks 3-4 + Phase 5B)

**Rationale**:
- Declare project complete at 82%
- Accept infrastructure-ready MVP as final deliverable
- Forgo user validation and expansion
- Skip feedback-driven improvements

**See**: [PHASE5_CANCELLATION_DECISION.md](../archive/phases/phase-5/cancelled/PHASE5_CANCELLATION_DECISION.md)
