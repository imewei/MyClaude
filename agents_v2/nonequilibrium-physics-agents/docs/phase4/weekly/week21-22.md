## Technical Implementation

### 1. Multi-Task Learning Architectures (2 types + clustering)

**Hard Parameter Sharing**
- Shared bottom layers, task-specific heads
- Most parameter efficient
- Best for highly related tasks

**Soft Parameter Sharing**
- Cross-stitch networks
- Task-specific columns with learned connections
- α[i,j] controls information flow between tasks
- Better handles negative transfer

**Task Clustering**
- Automatic grouping via similarity metrics
- Agglomerative clustering based on:
  - Feature distribution similarity
  - Output correlation
- Cluster-specific shared models

### 2. Enhanced Gradient-Based Meta-Learning (5 algorithms)

**MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning)**
- Meta-learns initialization for fast adaptation
- Inner loop: Adapt to task (k gradient steps)
- Outer loop: Meta-gradient through adaptation
- Backprop through inner loop optimization

**Reptile (First-Order MAML)**
- Simpler, no second-order gradients
- Algorithm: θ ← θ + ε(φ_i - θ) where φ_i = adapted params
- 2-3x faster than MAML, similar performance

**ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop)**
- Key insight: Only meta-learn head, not body
- Body trained normally, head meta-learned
- Faster than MAML with comparable results

**Task-Conditional Meta-Learning**
- Learns task embeddings
- Task-specific initialization via embeddings
- Hypernetwork generates initial parameters

**Adaptive Inner Steps**
- Dynamically determines optimal gradient steps
- Stops when loss improvement < tolerance
- Prevents overfitting to small support sets

### 3. Task Relationship Discovery

**Task Similarity Computation**
```
similarity = 0.5 * feature_sim + 0.5 * output_sim

feature_sim = 1 / (1 + ||μ_X1 - μ_X2||)
output_sim = (corr(y1, y2) + 1) / 2
```

**Task Embeddings**
- Learn d-dimensional embedding per task
- Cosine similarity for task relationships
- Used for:
  - Transfer learning source selection
  - Task clustering
  - Conditional meta-learning

**Negative Transfer Detection**
- Monitors per-task performance
- Alerts if MTL < baseline - threshold
- Enables architecture adjustment

### 4. Loss Functions and Optimization

**Multi-Task Loss**
```
L_total = Σ_i w_i * L_task_i + λ * L_diversity

L_diversity = -Σ_{i<j} ||θ_i - θ_j||²  (encourage task differences)
```

**Meta-Learning Loss (MAML)**
```
Inner: φ_i = θ - α∇_θ L_support_i(θ)
Outer: θ ← θ - β∇_θ Σ_i L_query_i(φ_i)
```

### 5. Key Features

**Meta-Overfitting Detection**
- Split meta-training tasks into train/val
- Early stopping based on meta-validation loss
- Patience counter prevents premature stopping

**Task Diversity Regularization**
- Encourages task-specific parameters to differ
- Prevents degenerate solutions

**Cross-Stitch Networks**
- Linear combinations: h_i = Σ_j α_{ij} h_j
- Learned α matrix via softmax normalization

**Meta-Learning**:
- 5-10x faster adaptation to new tasks
- Few-shot learning (k=1-10 examples)

**Computational Cost**:
- MAML: O(K * N) per task (K=inner steps, N=params)
- Reptile: O(K * N) but simpler backprop
- ANIL: O(K * N_head) - only head adapted
