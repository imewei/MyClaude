## Testing Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. Performance Regression Tests
```python
# Establish quantitative thresholds
def test_small_system_performance():
    start_time = time.time()
    result = solve_lindblad_jax(...)
    elapsed = time.time() - start_time

    assert elapsed < 0.1, f"Took {elapsed:.3f}s, expected < 0.1s"
```

### 2. Cross-Solver Validation
```python
# Compare multiple methods on same problem
def test_pmp_vs_collocation_lqr():
    result_pmp = solver_pmp.solve(...)
    result_col = solver_col.solve(...)

    # Should agree within 15%
    rel_diff = abs(cost_pmp - cost_col) / mean([cost_pmp, cost_col])
    assert rel_diff < 0.15
```

### 3. Stress Testing
```python
# Test extreme parameters
def test_very_tight_constraints():
    u_min = -0.01  # Very tight
    u_max = 0.01

    result = solver.solve(..., u_min=u_min, u_max=u_max)

    # Should still respect bounds
    assert all(u >= u_min - 1e-6)
    assert all(u <= u_max + 1e-6)
```

### 4. Integration Workflows
```python
# End-to-end standard format workflow
def test_solver_input_to_pmp():
    solver_input = SolverInput(...)  # Standard format
    assert solver_input.validate()

    result = pmp_solver.solve(...)  # Solve

    solver_output = SolverOutput(...)  # Standard output
    assert solver_output.validate()
```
