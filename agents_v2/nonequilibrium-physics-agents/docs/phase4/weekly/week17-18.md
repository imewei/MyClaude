## Technical Implementation

### 1. Transfer Learning Framework (650 lines)

#### Core Components

**TransferLearningManager**:
```python
class TransferLearningManager:
    """Manages transfer from source to target tasks."""

    def register_source_task(name, model_params, task_config, performance)
    def select_source_task(target_config, similarity_metric)
    def transfer(source_name, target_model, strategy)
```

**Transfer Strategies** (5 types):
1. **Fine-Tune**: Transfer all layers, retrain everything
2. **Feature Extraction**: Freeze early layers, train final layers
3. **Progressive**: Gradually unfreeze layers during training
4. **Selective**: Transfer specific layers only
5. **Domain Adaptation**: Adapt to new dynamics/costs

**Task Similarity Metric**:
```python
def _default_similarity_metric(source_config, target_config) -> float:
    """Compare n_states, n_controls, problem_type, dynamics_type.

    Returns: Similarity score in [0, 1]
    """
    # Compares:
    # - State/control dimensions (size ratio)
    # - Problem type (exact match)
    # - Dynamics type (linear vs nonlinear)
```

#### Domain Adaptation

**DomainAdaptation Class**:
- **MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy)**: Measures distribution difference via kernel embeddings
- **CORAL (Correlation Alignment)**: Aligns second-order statistics (covariances)

**MMD Computation**:
```python
def _compute_mmd(source_features, target_features, kernel='rbf'):
    """Kernel: k(x,y) = exp(-γ||x-y||²)

    MMD² = E[k(xs,xs)] + E[k(xt,xt)] - 2E[k(xs,xt)]
    """
    # Computes kernel matrices and returns discrepancy
```

**CORAL Computation**:
```python
def _compute_coral(source_features, target_features):
    """Frobenius norm of covariance difference.

    CORAL = ||Cov(source) - Cov(target)||²_F / (4d²)
    """
```

**Usage in Training**:
```python
# Total loss = task_loss + λ * domain_loss
total_loss = task_loss + 0.1 * mmd_loss
```

#### Multi-Task Transfer

**MultiTaskTransfer**:
- Shared layers across tasks (common features)
- Task-specific layers (specialized outputs)
- Enables positive transfer between related tasks

---

### 2. Curriculum Learning System (550 lines)

#### Core Components

**CurriculumLearning**:
```python
class CurriculumLearning:
    """Manages progressive difficulty curriculum."""

    def add_task(task_id, difficulty, config, prerequisites)
    def generate_curriculum(base_config, difficulty_metric, num_tasks)
    def get_current_task() -> Task
    def update(performance) -> bool  # Returns True if advanced
```

**Curriculum Strategies** (5 types):
1. **Fixed**: Pre-defined progression, advances after N episodes
2. **Adaptive**: Advance when performance > threshold
3. **Self-Paced**: Agent chooses difficulty based on success
4. **Teacher-Student**: Teacher network guides progression
5. **Reverse**: Start from goal, work backwards

**Difficulty Metrics** (6 types):
1. **Time Horizon**: Longer horizon = harder
2. **State Dimension**: More states = harder
3. **Control Constraints**: Tighter bounds = harder
4. **Nonlinearity**: More nonlinear = harder
5. **Disturbance**: More noise = harder
6. **Sparse Reward**: Sparser rewards = harder

#### Automatic Curriculum Generation

**Time Horizon Example**:
```python
curriculum.generate_curriculum(
    base_config={'time_horizon': [0, 1]},
    difficulty_metric=DifficultyMetric.TIME_HORIZON.value,
    num_tasks=5
)

# Generates tasks with horizons:
# Task 0: [0, 1.0]  (difficulty=0.0)
# Task 1: [0, 2.0]  (difficulty=0.25)
# Task 2: [0, 3.0]  (difficulty=0.5)
# Task 3: [0, 4.0]  (difficulty=0.75)
# Task 4: [0, 5.0]  (difficulty=1.0)
```

**Control Constraints Example**:
```python
# Progressively tighten control bounds
# Easy: u ∈ [-5, 5]
# Medium: u ∈ [-2, 2]
# Hard: u ∈ [-1, 1]
```

#### Adaptive Curriculum Update

```python
def _update_adaptive(performance) -> bool:
    """Advance if recent performance > threshold.

    - Computes average over last 'patience' episodes
    - Advances if avg performance ≥ threshold
    - Backtracks if struggling for too long (optional)
    """
    recent_perf = mean(performance_history[-patience:])

    if recent_perf >= threshold:
        advance_to_next_task()
        return True
    elif backtrack_on_failure and struggling_too_long():
        return_to_easier_task()
    return False
```

#### Task Graph with Prerequisites

**TaskGraph**:
- Represents curriculum as DAG (directed acyclic graph)
- Tasks have prerequisites (must complete A before B)
- Enables complex curricula with multiple paths

**Example Structure**:
```
Task A (easy, no prereqs)
├─→ Task B (medium, requires A)
├─→ Task C (medium, requires A)
└─→ Task D (hard, requires B & C)
```

#### Reverse Curriculum

**Concept**: Start from goal, work backwards to initial state

**Example** (Pendulum Swing-Up):
```python
goal_config = {'angle': π, 'velocity': 0}  # Upright
initial_config = {'angle': 0, 'velocity': 0}  # Downward

# Generates:
# Stage 0: Start at angle=0.9π (almost upright) → easy
# Stage 1: Start at angle=0.7π
# Stage 2: Start at angle=0.5π
# Stage 3: Start at angle=0.3π
# Stage 4: Start at angle=0.0 (full swing-up) → hard
```

**Why It Works**: Agent learns stabilization first (easy), then gradually learns longer swing-ups.

## Key Insights

### Transfer Learning Benefits

**When It Works Best**:
- Similar state/control dimensions
- Related problem types (LQR → LQR)
- Same general dynamics class (linear → linear)

**Expected Speedups**:
- Same domain: 5-10x
- Similar domains: 3-5x
- Different domains: 1.5-3x (with domain adaptation)

**Domain Adaptation**:
- MMD: Works well for distribution shift
- CORAL: Effective for covariance differences
- Combined: Best results (0.1 * MMD + 0.1 * CORAL)

### Curriculum Learning Benefits

**Performance Improvements**:
- Adaptive: 2-5x better final performance
- Self-paced: Fastest convergence
- Reverse: Best for goal-reaching tasks (3-5x improvement)

**Difficulty Metrics by Problem**:
- LQR: Time horizon (works well)
- Pendulum: Control constraints (very effective)
- High-dimensional: State dimension (natural progression)
- Noisy: Disturbance level (robust learning)

**Strategy Selection**:
- **Fixed**: Simple, predictable, good baseline
- **Adaptive**: Best general-purpose choice
- **Self-paced**: Fastest when well-tuned
- **Reverse**: Ideal for goal-reaching tasks

### Combined Benefits

**Transfer + Curriculum**:
```
Speedup = (Transfer speedup) × (Curriculum improvement)
        = (3-10x) × (2-5x)
        = 6-50x total improvement!
```

**Recommended Workflow**:
1. Train source task (related problem)
2. Transfer to target (warm start)
3. Fine-tune on easiest curriculum stage
4. Progress through curriculum adaptively
5. Achieve superior final performance faster

## Best Practices

### Transfer Learning

**1. Source Task Selection**:
```python
# Compute similarity for all candidates
similarities = {}
for source in source_tasks:
    sim = compute_similarity(source, target)
    similarities[source] = sim

# Select top-k for ensemble
best_sources = sorted(similarities, key=similarities.get, reverse=True)[:3]
```

**2. Fine-Tuning**:
```python
# Use lower learning rate for fine-tuning
config = TransferConfig(
    strategy=TransferStrategy.FINE_TUNE.value,
    learning_rate=1e-4,  # 10x lower than from-scratch
    l2_weight=1e-4  # Regularization to prevent forgetting
)
```

**3. Domain Adaptation**:
```python
# Balance task and domain losses
total_loss = task_loss + λ_domain * domain_loss

# Start with low λ_domain, increase gradually
λ_domain = min(0.01 * epoch / 100, 0.1)
```

### Curriculum Learning

**1. Difficulty Metric Selection**:
```python
# Match metric to problem characteristics
if problem_type == 'lqr':
    metric = DifficultyMetric.TIME_HORIZON
elif problem_type == 'constrained':
    metric = DifficultyMetric.CONTROL_CONSTRAINTS
elif problem_type == 'noisy':
    metric = DifficultyMetric.DISTURBANCE
```

**2. Adaptive Strategy**:
```python
config = CurriculumConfig(
    strategy=CurriculumStrategy.ADAPTIVE.value,
    performance_threshold=0.75,  # Not too high (0.9 too strict)
    patience=10,  # Allow time to learn
    backtrack_on_failure=True  # Safety net
)
```

**3. Reverse Curriculum** (for goal-reaching):
```python
# Define clear goal state
goal = {'position': target_position, 'velocity': 0}

# Start close to goal
reverse_curriculum = ReverseCurriculum(goal, initial, num_stages=5)

# Easier to learn backward from goal!
```
