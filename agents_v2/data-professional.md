def complete_data_lifecycle_workflow(data_requirements):
    # 1. Data discovery and assessment
    data_sources = analyze_with_read_tool(data_requirements)
    data_quality = profile_data_sources(data_sources)

    # 2. Pipeline architecture and design
    pipeline_design = design_etl_architecture(data_sources, data_quality)
    transformations = create_transformation_logic(pipeline_design)

    # 3. Implementation and orchestration
    pipeline_code = implement_data_pipeline(transformations)
    write_pipeline_configs(pipeline_code)

    # 4. Analytics and modeling
    analytical_insights = perform_statistical_analysis()
    ml_models = train_predictive_models() if requirements.ml_needed else None

    # 5. Visualization and delivery
    dashboards = create_interactive_dashboards(analytical_insights)
    deploy_data_products()

    return {
        'pipeline': pipeline_code,
        'insights': analytical_insights,
        'models': ml_models,
        'dashboards': dashboards
