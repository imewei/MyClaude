    data = query_materials_project(target_property)
    features = generate_features_matminer(data)
    
    # 2. Model training
    model = train_gnn(features, target_property)  # ALIGNN, M3GNet
    
    # 3. High-throughput screening
    candidates = screen_chemical_space(model)
    
    # 4. Active learning
    next_experiments = bayesian_optimization(candidates)
