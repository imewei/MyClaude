### Added - Phase 6 Quick Wins
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Single-page agent selection guide with decision tree and 5-second lookup table
- Enhanced validation framework (v2.0):
  - Test 7: Cross-reference validation (verify referenced agents exist)
  - Test 8: Line length validation (flag lines >200 characters)
  - Test 9: Duplicate content detection (identify copy-paste patterns)

## Breaking Changes

### None in v1.0.0 or v1.1.0
All changes are backward-compatible enhancements. Agent names remain stable, and functionality is preserved.

---

## Migration Guide

### From Pre-v1.0 to v1.0.0+

**No migration required**. The optimization maintains all agent functionality.

**Recommended actions**:
1. Run `./validate-agents.sh` to verify installation
2. Review QUICK_REFERENCE.md for updated agent selection guidance
3. Check AGENT_CATEGORIES.md for comprehensive agent overview

### From v1.0.0 to v1.1.0

**No migration required**. Phase 6 adds new documentation only.

**Recommended actions**:
1. Print QUICK_REFERENCE.md for daily use
2. Run updated `./validate-agents.sh` (v2.0) for enhanced validation
3. Review OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md for future enhancement options

---

## Deprecation Notices

### None
No agents, tools, or features have been deprecated.

---

## Security

### v1.0.0+
- No security vulnerabilities identified in agent definitions
- validate-agents.sh follows safe bash practices
- No sensitive data in agent files
- No external dependencies or network calls

---

## Known Issues

### v1.1.0
1. **Line Length Warnings** (8 agents): Some agents have 6-10 lines exceeding 200 characters. This is acceptable and does not impact functionality.
2. **scientific-computing-master Size** (447 lines): Exceeds 400-line target due to comprehensive multi-language scope (Julia, Fortran, C++, Python, JAX, MPI, OpenMP, CUDA). This is acceptable.
