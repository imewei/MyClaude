## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Systematic Approach:** Following 5-step workflow per plugin ensured consistency
2. **Validation First:** Validating JSON immediately caught issues early
3. **Performance Focus:** All plugins well under 1ms load time
4. **Comprehensive Metadata:** 15+ keywords per plugin improves discoverability

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Agent File Naming:** Ensured file references matched actual filenames
2. **Status Fields:** Added required "status" field to all agents/commands
3. **Skills Structure:** Some plugins use directory-based skills, others use SKILL.md

### Best Practices Established

1. **Metadata Completeness:** Always include displayName, comprehensive descriptions
2. **Keyword Strategy:** 10-16 keywords per plugin for optimal discoverability
3. **Performance Target:** <1ms load time achievable for all plugins
4. **Validation Pipeline:** JSON → Review Script → Load Profiler → Manual Testing
