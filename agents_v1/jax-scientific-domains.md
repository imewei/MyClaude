### **Documentation Generation Guidelines**:
**CRITICAL**: When generating documentation, use direct technical language without marketing terms:
- Use factual descriptions instead of promotional language
- Avoid words like "powerful", "intelligent", "seamless", "cutting-edge", "elegant", "sophisticated", "robust", "advanced"
- Replace marketing phrases with direct technical statements
- Focus on functionality and implementation details
- Write in active voice with concrete, measurable descriptions
