- Generates Mermaid visualization diagrams
- Detects isolated plugins

**Results:**
- Analyzed 22 plugins
- Found 29 cross-references
- Identified 5 plugins with dependencies
- Detected 10 referenced plugins
- Generated dependency graph with Mermaid visualization

**Output:** `reports/dependency-map.md`

### 2. Terminology Consistency Analyzer (`terminology-analyzer.py`)

**Purpose:** Analyzes terminology usage and consistency across all plugins

**Features:**
- Extracts technical terms from all plugin files
- Identifies terminology variations (spelling, hyphenation, capitalization)
- Maps synonyms and inconsistencies
- Detects British vs American spelling
- Validates framework name capitalization
- Provides standardization recommendations

**Results:**
- Extracted 6,604 term occurrences
- Identified 292 unique normalized terms
- Detected 40 terminology variations
- Found 254 internal inconsistencies
- Generated comprehensive standardization guide

**Output:** `reports/terminology-analysis.md`

### 3. Integration Workflow Generator (`workflow-generator.py`)

**Purpose:** Generates integration workflow documentation for multi-plugin scenarios

**Features:**
- Identifies common plugin combinations
- Generates workflow documentation templates
- Creates integration examples

**Predefined Workflows:**
1. Scientific Computing Full-Stack Workflow
2. Julia SciML + Bayesian Analysis
3. Machine Learning Development Pipeline
4. Full-Stack Web Application
5. Molecular Dynamics Simulation
6. Code Quality Assurance
7. JAX Scientific Computing
8. CI/CD Testing Pipeline

**Results:**
- Generated 5 workflows from existing plugins
- Covered 3 categories (scientific-computing, development, quality)
- Created step-by-step integration guides
- Provided example usage for each workflow

**Output:** `reports/integration-workflows.md`

### 4. Cross-Reference Validator (`xref-validator.py`)

**Purpose:** Validates all cross-plugin references to ensure accuracy

**Features:**
- Checks all cross-plugin references in documentation
- Validates agent, command, and skill mentions
- Identifies broken references
- Detects invalid plugin names
- Validates markdown links
- Provides detailed error reports

**Results:**
- Validated 28 cross-references
- 100% validity rate (0 broken references)
- Indexed 22 plugins
- Generated validation report with recommendations

**Output:** `reports/xref-validation.md`

```bash
python3 tools/xref-validator.py --plugins-dir plugins --output reports/xref-validation.md
```

### Complete Integration Analysis Workflow
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Step 1: Map Plugin Dependencies ==="
python3 tools/dependency-mapper.py --plugins-dir plugins --output reports/dependency-map.md

echo "=== Step 2: Analyze Terminology Consistency ==="
python3 tools/terminology-analyzer.py --plugins-dir plugins --output reports/terminology-analysis.md

echo "=== Step 3: Generate Integration Workflows ==="
python3 tools/workflow-generator.py --plugins-dir plugins --output reports/integration-workflows.md

echo "=== Step 4: Validate Cross-References ==="
python3 tools/xref-validator.py --plugins-dir plugins --output reports/xref-validation.md

echo "✓ Cross-plugin integration analysis complete!"
```

## Key Insights from Analysis

### Dependencies
- 5 plugins have dependencies on other plugins
- 10 plugins are referenced by others
- hpc-computing is the most referenced (8 references)
- deep-learning is highly referenced (6 references)
- Several plugins are isolated (no cross-references)

### Terminology
- 40 different variations of technical terms found
- Common issues: British vs American spelling, hyphenation inconsistencies, framework capitalization
- 254 internal inconsistencies where same plugin uses multiple forms
- Standardization needed for: optimization, visualization, parallelization, framework names

### Workflows
- Scientific computing plugins work well together
- Clear integration patterns in ML/DL workflows
- Quality assurance plugins form natural workflow
- Some predefined workflows reference missing plugins (opportunity for expansion)

### Cross-References
- All existing cross-references are valid
- No broken links detected
- Most references are to agents (22) and plugins (6)
- Documentation quality is high

## Performance

All tools execute efficiently:
- dependency-mapper.py: ~2-3 seconds for 22 plugins
- terminology-analyzer.py: ~5-10 seconds for full analysis
- workflow-generator.py: ~1-2 seconds for all workflows
- xref-validator.py: ~3-5 seconds for all references

Total integration analysis: ~15-20 seconds for complete marketplace analysis
