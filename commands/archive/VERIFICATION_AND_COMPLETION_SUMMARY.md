## 11. Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem 1: Agent Not Invoked
**Symptoms**: Claude doesn't use specified agent

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Verify agent name spelling: `light-scattering-optical-expert` (not `light-scattering`)
- ✅ Explicitly request: "Use [agent-name] to..."
- ✅ Check agent file exists in `~/.claude/agents/`

### Problem 2: Results Don't Match Across Agents
**Symptoms**: DLS size ≠ TEM size, MD viscosity ≠ rheometry

**Solutions**:
- ✅ **Normal!** Different techniques have different sensitivities
- ✅ DLS measures hydrodynamic radius (solvation shell), TEM measures core
- ✅ MD captures molecular scale, rheology measures bulk (may have aggregates)
- ✅ Use cross-validation sections in agent outputs

### Problem 3: Agent Recommends Unavailable Tool
**Symptoms**: Agent suggests VASP calculation but no license

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Specify constraints: "Use open-source DFT (Quantum ESPRESSO)"
- ✅ Alternative methods: "Use ML force field instead of DFT"
- ✅ Delegate: "Use simulation-expert with MLFF trained on DFT data"

### Problem 4: Too Many Options, Confused
**Symptoms**: Don't know which agent to use

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Use Decision Tree in AGENTS_QUICKREF.md
- ✅ Start with Characterization Master to design strategy
- ✅ Describe problem to Claude: "I have X, want to know Y"
