# Ultra Think: Advanced Multi-Dimensional Reasoning

**Deep analysis and problem solving with cognitive frameworks, sequential reasoning, and meta-cognitive awareness**

## Your Task: $ARGUMENTS

---

## ðŸ§  Ultra Think Framework

This command activates **maximum cognitive depth** for complex problem-solving, combining:
- **Sequential Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** (via MCP tool)
- **Multiple Cognitive Frameworks** (First Principles, Systems Thinking, etc.)
- **Cross-Domain Analysis** (Technical, Business, User, System perspectives)
- **Hypothesis Generation & Testing**
- **Meta-Cognitive Reflection**
- **Bias Detection & Mitigation**

---

## Phase 1: Problem Initialization & Decomposition

### 1.1 Activate Ultra Think Mode

**Initialize Sequential Thinking Chain:**
Use the `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool to maintain a rigorous chain of thought throughout the analysis.

**Start with:**
- Thought 1: Parse and understand the core problem
- Establish initial thought budget (estimate 20-50 thoughts for complex problems)
- Enable revision capability for course correction

### 1.2 Problem Parsing & Clarification

**Extract the Core Challenge:**
- Primary question or problem: `$ARGUMENTS`
- Identify the **actual** problem vs. the **stated** problem (XY problem check)
- Determine problem category:
  - [ ] Technical/Engineering
  - [ ] Business/Strategic
  - [ ] Design/UX
  - [ ] Research/Scientific
  - [ ] Organizational/Process
  - [ ] Hybrid (multiple categories)

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- Who is affected by this problem?
- Who benefits from solving it?
- Who might resist the solution?
- What are their priorities and constraints?

**Constraint Identification:**
- Technical constraints (performance, scalability, compatibility)
- Resource constraints (time, budget, people)
- Business constraints (market, competition, regulations)
- Political constraints (stakeholder interests, organizational dynamics)

**Assumption Surfacing:**
- What assumptions are we making?
- Which assumptions are critical vs. nice-to-have?
- Which assumptions should we validate?
- What are the unstated assumptions?

**Unknown Unknowns:**
- What don't we know that we don't know?
- What information gaps exist?
- What could surprise us?
- Where should we do research first?

---

## Phase 2: Multi-Framework Analysis

### 2.1 First Principles Thinking

**Break down to fundamental truths:**
1. What do we **know** to be true (empirical facts)?
2. What are the **immutable constraints** (laws of physics, mathematics)?
3. What are the **core components** (irreducible elements)?
4. How can we **reconstruct** from these fundamentals?

**Example:**
```
Problem: "How do we build a faster search?"
First Principles:
- Search speed = O(n) for linear, O(log n) for binary
- Data structure determines access pattern
- Indexing trades space for time
- Rebuild: Could we pre-compute common queries? Use inverted index?
```

### 2.2 Systems Thinking

**Analyze as interconnected system:**

**Components & Relationships:**
- What are the key components?
- How do they interact?
- What are the feedback loops (positive/negative)?
- Where are the leverage points?

**System Dynamics:**
- What happens over time?
- Are there delays in the system?
- What are the equilibrium states?
- What emergent behaviors might arise?

**Boundaries & Environment:**
- What defines the system boundary?
- What external factors influence it?
- What does the system influence externally?
- How does context change the system?

### 2.3 Inversion Thinking

**Consider what to avoid:**
- What would guarantee failure?
- What are the anti-goals?
- What should we explicitly **not** do?
- What would Charlie Munger say to avoid?

**Example:**
```
Instead of: "How to succeed?"
Invert to: "How to fail spectacularly?"
- Ignore user feedback â†’ Do: Establish feedback loops
- Build without testing â†’ Do: Test early and often
- Optimize prematurely â†’ Do: Profile before optimizing
```

### 2.4 Second-Order Thinking

**Consequences of consequences:**

**Order 1:** What happens immediately?
**Order 2:** What happens because of that?
**Order 3:** What happens in the long term?

**Example:**
```
Decision: Use caching to improve performance
Order 1: Response times improve
Order 2: Cache invalidation becomes complex
Order 3: System becomes harder to reason about, bugs increase
Conclusion: Need cache invalidation strategy from day 1
```

### 2.5 Probabilistic Thinking

**Work with uncertainties:**

**For each solution, estimate:**
- **P(Success)**: Probability of success
- **Expected Value**: P(Success) Ã— Benefit
- **Confidence Interval**: How certain are we?
- **Black Swan Risk**: What extreme events could occur?

**Bayesian Updates:**
- Prior belief: What did we think before analysis?
- Evidence: What have we learned?
- Posterior belief: Updated probability

### 2.6 Mental Models Toolkit

Apply relevant mental models:

**Cognitive Models:**
- **Occam's Razor**: Simplest explanation is often correct
- **Hanlon's Razor**: Don't attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence
- **Pareto Principle**: 80/20 rule
- **Lindy Effect**: The longer something has survived, the longer it's likely to survive

**Decision Models:**
- **Regret Minimization**: Will I regret not doing this in 10 years?
- **Reversibility**: Is this decision easy to reverse?
- **Expected Value**: Probability Ã— Outcome
- **Opportunity Cost**: What am I giving up?

**Engineering Models:**
- **CAP Theorem**: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance (pick 2)
- **SOLID Principles**: Software design principles
- **Conway's Law**: System design mirrors organizational structure
- **Hyrum's Law**: All observable behaviors will be depended upon

---

## Phase 3: Cognitive Framework Selection

### 3.1 Choose Thinking Framework(s)

Based on the problem type, apply appropriate framework:

#### **6 Thinking Hats** (for comprehensive perspective)

**White Hat (Facts):**

- What are the objective facts?

**Red Hat (Emotions/Intuition):**
- What does gut instinct say?
- How do people feel about this?
- What are the emotional considerations?

**Black Hat (Judgment/Caution):**
- What could go wrong?
- What are the risks?
- Why might this fail?

**Yellow Hat (Optimism/Benefits):**
- What are the benefits?
- Best-case scenarios?
- What value does this create?

**Green Hat (Creativity):**
- What are creative alternatives?
- Can we think outside the box?
- What unconventional approaches exist?

**Blue Hat (Process):**

- What's our process?
- Are we on track?

#### **SCAMPER** (for innovation)

- **S**ubstitute: What can we replace?
- **C**ombine: What can we merge?
- **A**dapt: What can we adjust?
- **M**odify: What can we change?
- **P**ut to other uses: Can we repurpose?
- **E**liminate: What can we remove?
- **R**everse: What if we do the opposite?

#### **Cynefin Framework** (for complexity assessment)

**Determine domain:**
- **Obvious**: Best practices apply (use standard solution)
- **Complicated**: Good practices apply (analyze then solve)
- **Complex**: Emergent practices (probe-sense-respond)
- **Chaotic**: Novel practices (act-sense-respond)
- **Confused**: Need to break down further

#### **5 Whys** (for root cause analysis)

Ask "Why?" five times to get to root cause:
```
Problem: Application crashes
Why? â†’ Memory leak
Why? â†’ Objects not garbage collected
Why? â†’ Circular references
Why? â†’ Event listeners not removed
Why? â†’ No cleanup in component lifecycle
Root Cause: Missing cleanup logic
```
